For stationary time series with a finite mean (𝜇) and long-run variance (𝜎^2), the CLT holds, meaning the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution with mean 𝜇 and variance 𝜎^2/n, where n is the number of observations.  The CLT applies to time series as long as the series is stationary and the observations are independent.\"\n",

This is crucial for statistical inference because it allows us to generalize results from a sample to the population.

Time series data often exhibits dependence, where values at one point in time are correlated with values at previous time points. This violates the independence assumption. Furthermore, real-world time series are not always stationary; their statistical properties can change over time. This is another violation of the CLT assumptions. To address these issues, we can try to transform the time series to make it stationary, using techniques such as differencing or other transformations. Additionally, we can explore alternative versions of the CLT that accommodate dependence, such as the CLT for M-dependent random variables.\"\n",

These dependencies, also known as autocorrelations, reflect the relationships between observations at different time points. Standard methods for time series analysis often assume independence or a specific form of dependence, which can be violated in real-world data. Ignoring these dependencies can lead to inaccurate models and predictions.

In contrast, non-deterministic time series contain a random component and cannot be fully predicted based on past values alone. They typically exhibit randomness or noise.
