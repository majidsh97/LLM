    "Indoor Localization With Robust Global Channel Charting: A Time-Distance-Based Approach'''\n",
    "abstract = '''Abstract:\n",
    "Fingerprinting (FP) significantly improves the indoor localization performance in non-line-of-sight-dominated areas. However, its deployment and maintenance is cost-intensive as it needs ground-truth reference systems for both the initial training and the adaption to environmental changes. Recently, channel charting (CC) has been investigated because it is an unsupervised method that does not need labeled measurement data. CC uses pairwise-distance metrics to estimate the physical distance between channel-state-information (CSI) measurements in the proximity. CC can then learn the underlying manifold of the channel measurements. While CC has shown promising results in modelling the local geometry of the radio environment, a deeper insight into CC for localization using multi-anchor large-bandwidth measurements is still pending. We therefore contribute a novel distance metric for CC that approaches a global linear correlation to the physical distance based on time-synchronized single-input/single-output (SISO) CSIs. This allows to learn the environmentâ€™s global geometry in a channel chart without annotations. We leverage a Siamese network, which enables CC-assisted FP only using a linear transformation from the chart to the real-world coordinates. We compare our approach to the state-of-the-art of CC on two different real-world data sets recorded with a 5G and UWB radio setup. Unlike FP-based localization which needs a large number of labeled data points to achieve a superior localization accuracy, our approach outperforms FP when only a few labeled data samples are available.'''\n",
    "future = '''\n",
    "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
    "The experiments have shown that neighborhood-graph-based algorithms, e.g., C. UMAP, Isomap, and the proposed geodesic Siamese network, are superior in the generation of channel charts compared to the other algorithms. We think that this is due to the fact that they only consider local distances, which is advantageous as the CSI distance is proportional to the physical distance in the proximity of two CSI measurements. This leads to the optimization of the channel chart considering only the valid local connections between CSIs. However, this also means that, ideally, a uniform distribution of high data density should be available to create a valid global neighborhood graph. As the idea of CC is that every user in the environment can contribute to the underlying data set, the amount of collected data will grow rapidly, which leads to a high data density. However, this does not necessarily imply that the density of data has a uniform distribution in the radio environment. While this is not a problem, as long as the data density is high, methods that rely on proximity distances, such as nearest-neighbor approaches, have to calculate a distance matrix, which has a complexity of O(n2) .\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are good approximations for neighborhood graphs [54] the complexity is still non-linear, which restricts the most promising algorithms to small data sets. The selection of the most necessary information of the recorded data is therefore important, but a non-trivial problem, as a random selection of samples might lead to redundant CSIs at high density regions of the environment and therefore also to a under representation of low-density regions. As the collection of data is unsupervised, a spatial selection of data is impossible, which makes the sample selection challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is to exploit CC for positioning. As the channel chart only reflects the local geometry, a transformation into the global real-world coordinate frame is necessary. In Section VI-D, we have shown that a simple affine transformation, estimated using only 10 to 20 reference-coordinates samples, is already enough to provide high localization accuracies, while supervised FP needs 50 times more labeled data samples to achieve similar results. However, supervised FP can achieve an even higher localization performance if a high number of labeled data samples is available. As shown in [13], supervised FP needs a good coverage of labeled data samples in the radio environment due to the restricted interpolation abilities. This means that for larger areas the numbers of needed labeled training samples also increases, which is not the case for CC-assisted FP as only an alignment of coordinates frames is needed. We therefore think that CC-assisted FP is especially useful when only a low amount of labeled data samples is available and in large areas, as the linear transformation only requires a small amount of annotated data, which does not scale with the size of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further problem is that the consistency of the channel chart mainly depends on the data collected in a certain scenario. Environmental changes may alter the environment-specific CSI, which leads to errors in the prediction. This is a common problem in FP models [13] and makes an identification of environmental changes and an update necessary over time. This might also be needed for channel charts rendering a CC life-cycle management essential for a robust sage for downstream tasks.\n",

    "Estimating Multipath Component Delays With Transformer Models\n",
    "'''\n",
    "abstract = '''Abstract:\n",
    "Multipath in radio propagation provides essential environmental information that is exploited for positioning or channel-simultaneous localization and mapping. This enables accurate and robust localization that requires less infrastructure than traditional methods. A key factor is the reliable and accurate extraction of multipath components (MPCs). However, limited bandwidth and signal fading make it difficult to detect and determine the parameters of the individual signal components. In this article, we propose multipath delay estimation based on a transformer neural network. In contrast to the state of the art, we implicitly estimate the number of MPCs and achieve subsample accuracy without using computationally intensive super-resolution techniques. Our approach outperforms known methods in detection performance and accuracy at different bandwidths. Our ablation study shows exceptional results on simulated and real datasets and generalizes to unknown radio environments.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "future = '''\n",
    "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
    "This section discusses our findings along input variants, sensitivity, generalization, and environment-specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments on different input data (CIR and PDP) show no significant performance difference between TF on CIR and TF on PDP input data on all three datasets (sensitivity: âˆ’4%, precision: âˆ’3%, MADE: âˆ’5 cm). This clarifies that PDP signals contain similarly valuable information as CIR signals. However, PDP signals halve the data management effort and are, therefore, the first choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods accurately estimate delays of the MPCs at high signal power. But delays of late arriving, attenuated or overlapping MPCs are often estimated inaccurately. Ignoring them, leads to high precision and low MADE, but at the same time low sensitivity. In consequence, essential spatial information is lost and the positioning accuracy worsens. The best example of this is MUSIC. It estimates MPCs, such as the direct path very accurately, but fails to detect most (remaining) MPCs in a channel measurement. Instead, our TF detects most MPCs (synthetic 5G: 72.0% and UWB: 57.8%, real-world UWB: 100%) with delay accuracy as MUSIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments show that TF extracts delays of MPCs accurately and robustly. However, DL-based approaches, such as TF and U-Net, are not limited to this task. For example, TF could estimate additional parameters, such as AoA, in multiple input multiple output setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments show that TF generalizes to unknown environments and exploits environment-specific features best. The synthetic UWB dataset does not represent a specific environment. Each data point is assigned a stochastic (unknown) environmental interaction. Therefore, the real-world UWB dataset only contains information that is independent of the environment. Here, although TF cannot exploit spatial and temporal (environmental) dependencies in the entire signal, TF still outperforms all other methods because, unlike all other methods, TF potentially captures the (physical) channel properties of the system. Based on this valuable additional knowledge about the system characteristics, TF estimates significantly more accurately and reliably than all other methods. As TF is the only method to capture dependencies across the entire input signal (and dataset), it also captures environment-specific patterns within it. Based on this valuable additional spatial and temporal knowledge, TF estimates significantly more accurately and reliably than all other methods. For example, the real UWB dataset represents a static environment. Alike, the synthetic 5G dataset represents static elements in a dynamic environment. TF yields the best results of all methods here as TF directly learns the hidden environment-specific patterns in the signal (dataset). It is possible that TF also learns additional environmentally independent information when it is trained on input signals from different environments. In essence, environment independence reduces deployment effort and exploiting environment-specific patterns improves accuracy and reliability. This renders TF a realistic and practical method beyond the state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we showed that our MPC delay estimation based on a TF neural network achieves more accurate, precise, and sensitive results than the state of the art. We demonstrated this for three radio systems with different bandwidth limitations and sampling rates. The key features of our method are the implicit estimation of the number of MPCs and the ability to resolve dependencies throughout the input signal (and beyond). The latter provide TF with additional spatial and temporal information about the environment that is hidden from other methods, and result in outstanding positioning performance. Our experiments show that the spatially consistent channels of environments with certain characteristic interactions, e.g., wall reflections, improve the overall performance of TF. As TF (regresses) estimates the MPC delays directly and attends all signal characteristics, it can achieve subsample accuracy. Our experiments also show that TF estimates early arriving MPCs with exceptional accuracy and particularly low uncertainty. Although our TF's inference time increases with more estimates, it is shorter than that of most other methods. In addition, less complex PDP input data do not affect TF, as TF still extracts important information from the signal. However, PDP significantly reduces the effort involved in data processing and storage as it halves the input. In future work, we will increase the amount of environmental information extracted from the channel and comprehensively evaluate TF in real-world scenarios to better understand its limitations.\n",
