    "Indoor Localization With Robust Global Channel Charting: A Time-Distance-Based Approach'''\n",
    "abstract = '''Abstract:\n",
    "Fingerprinting (FP) significantly improves the indoor localization performance in non-line-of-sight-dominated areas. However, its deployment and maintenance is cost-intensive as it needs ground-truth reference systems for both the initial training and the adaption to environmental changes. Recently, channel charting (CC) has been investigated because it is an unsupervised method that does not need labeled measurement data. CC uses pairwise-distance metrics to estimate the physical distance between channel-state-information (CSI) measurements in the proximity. CC can then learn the underlying manifold of the channel measurements. While CC has shown promising results in modelling the local geometry of the radio environment, a deeper insight into CC for localization using multi-anchor large-bandwidth measurements is still pending. We therefore contribute a novel distance metric for CC that approaches a global linear correlation to the physical distance based on time-synchronized single-input/single-output (SISO) CSIs. This allows to learn the environmentâ€™s global geometry in a channel chart without annotations. We leverage a Siamese network, which enables CC-assisted FP only using a linear transformation from the chart to the real-world coordinates. We compare our approach to the state-of-the-art of CC on two different real-world data sets recorded with a 5G and UWB radio setup. Unlike FP-based localization which needs a large number of labeled data points to achieve a superior localization accuracy, our approach outperforms FP when only a few labeled data samples are available.'''\n",
    "future = '''\n",
    "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
    "The experiments have shown that neighborhood-graph-based algorithms, e.g., C. UMAP, Isomap, and the proposed geodesic Siamese network, are superior in the generation of channel charts compared to the other algorithms. We think that this is due to the fact that they only consider local distances, which is advantageous as the CSI distance is proportional to the physical distance in the proximity of two CSI measurements. This leads to the optimization of the channel chart considering only the valid local connections between CSIs. However, this also means that, ideally, a uniform distribution of high data density should be available to create a valid global neighborhood graph. As the idea of CC is that every user in the environment can contribute to the underlying data set, the amount of collected data will grow rapidly, which leads to a high data density. However, this does not necessarily imply that the density of data has a uniform distribution in the radio environment. While this is not a problem, as long as the data density is high, methods that rely on proximity distances, such as nearest-neighbor approaches, have to calculate a distance matrix, which has a complexity of O(n2) .\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are good approximations for neighborhood graphs [54] the complexity is still non-linear, which restricts the most promising algorithms to small data sets. The selection of the most necessary information of the recorded data is therefore important, but a non-trivial problem, as a random selection of samples might lead to redundant CSIs at high density regions of the environment and therefore also to a under representation of low-density regions. As the collection of data is unsupervised, a spatial selection of data is impossible, which makes the sample selection challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge is to exploit CC for positioning. As the channel chart only reflects the local geometry, a transformation into the global real-world coordinate frame is necessary. In Section VI-D, we have shown that a simple affine transformation, estimated using only 10 to 20 reference-coordinates samples, is already enough to provide high localization accuracies, while supervised FP needs 50 times more labeled data samples to achieve similar results. However, supervised FP can achieve an even higher localization performance if a high number of labeled data samples is available. As shown in [13], supervised FP needs a good coverage of labeled data samples in the radio environment due to the restricted interpolation abilities. This means that for larger areas the numbers of needed labeled training samples also increases, which is not the case for CC-assisted FP as only an alignment of coordinates frames is needed. We therefore think that CC-assisted FP is especially useful when only a low amount of labeled data samples is available and in large areas, as the linear transformation only requires a small amount of annotated data, which does not scale with the size of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further problem is that the consistency of the channel chart mainly depends on the data collected in a certain scenario. Environmental changes may alter the environment-specific CSI, which leads to errors in the prediction. This is a common problem in FP models [13] and makes an identification of environmental changes and an update necessary over time. This might also be needed for channel charts rendering a CC life-cycle management essential for a robust sage for downstream tasks.\n",

    "'''\n",
    "abstract = '''Abstract:\n",
    "Multipath in radio propagation provides essential environmental information that is exploited for positioning or channel-simultaneous localization and mapping. This enables accurate and robust localization that requires less infrastructure than traditional methods. A key factor is the reliable and accurate extraction of multipath components (MPCs). However, limited bandwidth and signal fading make it difficult to detect and determine the parameters of the individual signal components. In this article, we propose multipath delay estimation based on a transformer neural network. In contrast to the state of the art, we implicitly estimate the number of MPCs and achieve subsample accuracy without using computationally intensive super-resolution techniques. Our approach outperforms known methods in detection performance and accuracy at different bandwidths. Our ablation study shows exceptional results on simulated and real datasets and generalizes to unknown radio environments.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "future = '''\n",
    "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
    "This section discusses our findings along input variants, sensitivity, generalization, and environment-specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments on different input data (CIR and PDP) show no significant performance difference between TF on CIR and TF on PDP input data on all three datasets (sensitivity: âˆ’4%, precision: âˆ’3%, MADE: âˆ’5 cm). This clarifies that PDP signals contain similarly valuable information as CIR signals. However, PDP signals halve the data management effort and are, therefore, the first choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods accurately estimate delays of the MPCs at high signal power. But delays of late arriving, attenuated or overlapping MPCs are often estimated inaccurately. Ignoring them, leads to high precision and low MADE, but at the same time low sensitivity. In consequence, essential spatial information is lost and the positioning accuracy worsens. The best example of this is MUSIC. It estimates MPCs, such as the direct path very accurately, but fails to detect most (remaining) MPCs in a channel measurement. Instead, our TF detects most MPCs (synthetic 5G: 72.0% and UWB: 57.8%, real-world UWB: 100%) with delay accuracy as MUSIC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments show that TF extracts delays of MPCs accurately and robustly. However, DL-based approaches, such as TF and U-Net, are not limited to this task. For example, TF could estimate additional parameters, such as AoA, in multiple input multiple output setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiments show that TF generalizes to unknown environments and exploits environment-specific features best. The synthetic UWB dataset does not represent a specific environment. Each data point is assigned a stochastic (unknown) environmental interaction. Therefore, the real-world UWB dataset only contains information that is independent of the environment. Here, although TF cannot exploit spatial and temporal (environmental) dependencies in the entire signal, TF still outperforms all other methods because, unlike all other methods, TF potentially captures the (physical) channel properties of the system. Based on this valuable additional knowledge about the system characteristics, TF estimates significantly more accurately and reliably than all other methods. As TF is the only method to capture dependencies across the entire input signal (and dataset), it also captures environment-specific patterns within it. Based on this valuable additional spatial and temporal knowledge, TF estimates significantly more accurately and reliably than all other methods. For example, the real UWB dataset represents a static environment. Alike, the synthetic 5G dataset represents static elements in a dynamic environment. TF yields the best results of all methods here as TF directly learns the hidden environment-specific patterns in the signal (dataset). It is possible that TF also learns additional environmentally independent information when it is trained on input signals from different environments. In essence, environment independence reduces deployment effort and exploiting environment-specific patterns improves accuracy and reliability. This renders TF a realistic and practical method beyond the state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we showed that our MPC delay estimation based on a TF neural network achieves more accurate, precise, and sensitive results than the state of the art. We demonstrated this for three radio systems with different bandwidth limitations and sampling rates. The key features of our method are the implicit estimation of the number of MPCs and the ability to resolve dependencies throughout the input signal (and beyond). The latter provide TF with additional spatial and temporal information about the environment that is hidden from other methods, and result in outstanding positioning performance. Our experiments show that the spatially consistent channels of environments with certain characteristic interactions, e.g., wall reflections, improve the overall performance of TF. As TF (regresses) estimates the MPC delays directly and attends all signal characteristics, it can achieve subsample accuracy. Our experiments also show that TF estimates early arriving MPCs with exceptional accuracy and particularly low uncertainty. Although our TF's inference time increases with more estimates, it is shorter than that of most other methods. In addition, less complex PDP input data do not affect TF, as TF still extracts important information from the signal. However, PDP significantly reduces the effort involved in data processing and storage as it halves the input. In future work, we will increase the amount of environmental information extracted from the channel and comprehensively evaluate TF in real-world scenarios to better understand its limitations.\n",

    "Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences.

We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna.

    "The simultaneous planning of transmission network development and reactive power resources considering reliability constraints.'''\n",
    "abstract = '''Abstract:\n",
    "With the increasing load growth and the development of new generation resources in the power system, ensuring long-term consumer demand requires planning to strengthen or expand the electrical energy transmission network. Since the power system is exposed to numerous random incidents, such as unplanned equipment outages, the planning must be done in a way that reliability requirements are met. One of the key aspects of reliability that must be considered in planning is the security of the power system, which refers to its ability to handle contingencies. To ensure the security of the power system, both active and reactive power requirements must be simultaneously taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this thesis, the issue of transmission network development planning is studied with a focus on security, considering the N-1 security criterion applied to transmission equipment, with the goal of minimizing investment and operational costs in the target planning year. In these studies, it is assumed that the capacity and location of power plants, as well as the load demand of the power system, are determined in the form of a stepwise load duration curve for the target year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since conventional transmission development planning usually ignores reactive power requirements, first, the transmission network development planning problem, constrained by security based on direct power flow equations, is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Then, to consider both active and reactive power requirements in maintaining the power systemâ€™s security, the transmission development planning problem is modeled based on alternating power flow equations. In this modeling process, the reactive power planning issue is also considered simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee achieving the global optimal solution, the transmission planning problem is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem using the convexification technique for alternating power flow equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering all contingencies on existing and candidate transmission equipment at all load levels increases the number of variables and constraints in the planning problem, significantly increasing the optimization problemâ€™s size and leading to much longer solution times, or potentially making it impossible to solve. In this thesis, a repetitive method is proposed to solve the planning problem, aiming to reach a global optimal solution while reducing solution time. In this method, only a limited number of contingencies, added to the set of contingencies in successive iterations, are considered in the planning problem, such that selecting these contingencies at each load level is sufficient for considering the entire set of contingencies. In each iteration, the selected contingency at each load level is determined by solving the problem of identifying the most severe contingency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bi-level optimization problem. In the first level, the contingency that causes the greatest violation of constraints is found, constrained by the second level. The second level models the operator's response in the event of the selected contingency, aiming to minimize constraint violations while considering power system operational constraints. Due to the convexity of the second level problem, it can be transformed into a single-level optimization problem using duality techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models are implemented on standard test networks, including the IEEE 24-Bus and IEEE 118-Bus Garver networks, using the GAMS optimization software. The results show the proposed methodâ€™s capability to solve the planning problem within an acceptable time frame. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed model for simultaneous transmission network and reactive power resource development planning, constrained by security, can lead to an optimal economic development plan while considering the security requirements of the transmission system.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "future = '''\n",
    "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
    "In this thesis, a model for simultaneous planning of transmission network development and reactive power resources constrained by security was proposed, along with a new method for solving it. According to this method, among all possible contingencies, only a limited number are considered in the planning problem (SC-CTERPP). These selected contingencies are sufficient to cover the entire set of contingencies. To evaluate the development plan derived from solving the transmission network development problem from a power system security perspective, the DC security-constrained power flow equations were initially used in Chapter 2. The proposed method for solving this problem, which is done using a bi-level optimization approach, was then described. This approach uses DC techniques to determine the most severe contingency based on power flow equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 3, the convexification of the bi-level problem into a single-level optimization problem using MILP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) and linearization techniques was discussed. The SC-CTERPP method was then addressed, followed by the modeling of the AC power flow equations. This bi-level problem was also transformed using techniques for solving severe contingencies. In Chapter 4, the models were implemented on three MISOCP (Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming) test networks and analyzed from various aspects and approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features of the modeling and results are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Contingencies on existing and candidate transmission lines in all load levels are considered in the SC-CTERPP and SC-DCTEP models. The proposed method, which considers selected contingencies at each load level, effectively drives the solution towards the global optimum. Previous research has only considered a limited number of contingencies due to the large problem size and has generally used a single load level in the modeling. These approaches often do not consider various operational states or provide accurate estimates of operational costs. Moreover, constraints related to the ramp rates of generating units, which significantly impact system security, are typically not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The proposed method was also tested on relatively large networks. The results indicate that this method is a smart and capable approach towards achieving a global optimal solution. Additionally, considering a specific set of contingencies reduces the number of constraints and variables in the planning problem, thus significantly reducing the solution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The SC-DCTEP model does not ensure sufficient reliability in real conditions because it does not consider active losses and reactive loading of the transmission network. By modeling the problem based on AC power flow equations, it is possible to fully account for reactive power loading and voltage constraints, thereby achieving adequate system security to handle contingencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since the cost of constructing reactive power resources is much lower than that of constructing transmission lines, simultaneous planning of the transmission network and reactive power resources leads to both required reliability and the most cost-effective development plan. This conclusion is supported by comparing the results of simultaneous planning with hierarchical approaches, where ignoring reactive power resources often results in reduced transmission capacity and increased need for additional transmission lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If standards allow transmission lines to operate under contingency conditions up to their short-term thermal loading limits, consumer demand can be met with fewer transmission equipment, thereby reducing investment costs.\n",
    "\n",

      "The simultaneous planning of transmission network development and reactive power resources considering reliability constraints.\n",
      "Abstract:\n",
      "With the increasing load growth and the development of new generation resources in the power system, ensuring long-term consumer demand requires planning to strengthen or expand the electrical energy transmission network. Since the power system is exposed to numerous random incidents, such as unplanned equipment outages, the planning must be done in a way that reliability requirements are met. One of the key aspects of reliability that must be considered in planning is the security of the power system, which refers to its ability to handle contingencies. To ensure the security of the power system, both active and reactive power requirements must be simultaneously taken into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this thesis, the issue of transmission network development planning is studied with a focus on security, considering the N-1 security criterion applied to transmission equipment, with the goal of minimizing investment and operational costs in the target planning year. In these studies, it is assumed that the capacity and location of power plants, as well as the load demand of the power system, are determined in the form of a stepwise load duration curve for the target year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since conventional transmission development planning usually ignores reactive power requirements, first, the transmission network development planning problem, constrained by security based on direct power flow equations, is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Then, to consider both active and reactive power requirements in maintaining the power systemâ€™s security, the transmission development planning problem is modeled based on alternating power flow equations. In this modeling process, the reactive power planning issue is also considered simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "To guarantee achieving the global optimal solution, the transmission planning problem is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem using the convexification technique for alternating power flow equations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Considering all contingencies on existing and candidate transmission equipment at all load levels increases the number of variables and constraints in the planning problem, significantly increasing the optimization problemâ€™s size and leading to much longer solution times, or potentially making it impossible to solve. In this thesis, a repetitive method is proposed to solve the planning problem, aiming to reach a global optimal solution while reducing solution time. In this method, only a limited number of contingencies, added to the set of contingencies in successive iterations, are considered in the planning problem, such that selecting these contingencies at each load level is sufficient for considering the entire set of contingencies. In each iteration, the selected contingency at each load level is determined by solving the problem of identifying the most severe contingency. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a bi-level optimization problem. In the first level, the contingency that causes the greatest violation of constraints is found, constrained by the second level. The second level models the operator's response in the event of the selected contingency, aiming to minimize constraint violations while considering power system operational constraints. Due to the convexity of the second level problem, it can be transformed into a single-level optimization problem using duality techniques. \n",
      "\n",
      "The models are implemented on standard test networks, including the IEEE 24-Bus and IEEE 118-Bus Garver networks, using the GAMS optimization software. The results show the proposed methodâ€™s capability to solve the planning problem within an acceptable time frame. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed model for simultaneous transmission network and reactive power resource development planning, constrained by security, can lead to an optimal economic development plan while considering the security requirements of the transmission system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Discussion & Future Work:\n",
      "In this thesis, a model for simultaneous planning of transmission network development and reactive power resources constrained by security was proposed, along with a new method for solving it. According to this method, among all possible contingencies, only a limited number are considered in the planning problem (SC-CTERPP). These selected contingencies are sufficient to cover the entire set of contingencies. To evaluate the development plan derived from solving the transmission network development problem from a power system security perspective, the DC security-constrained power flow equations were initially used in Chapter 2. The proposed method for solving this problem, which is done using a bi-level optimization approach, was then described. This approach uses DC techniques to determine the most severe contingency based on power flow equations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chapter 3, the convexification of the bi-level problem into a single-level optimization problem using MILP (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming) and linearization techniques was discussed. The SC-CTERPP method was then addressed, followed by the modeling of the AC power flow equations. This bi-level problem was also transformed using techniques for solving severe contingencies. In Chapter 4, the models were implemented on three MISOCP (Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming) test networks and analyzed from various aspects and approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The features of the modeling and results are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Contingencies on existing and candidate transmission lines in all load levels are considered in the SC-CTERPP and SC-DCTEP models. The proposed method, which considers selected contingencies at each load level, effectively drives the solution towards the global optimum. Previous research has only considered a limited number of contingencies due to the large problem size and has generally used a single load level in the modeling. These approaches often do not consider various operational states or provide accurate estimates of operational costs. Moreover, constraints related to the ramp rates of generating units, which significantly impact system security, are typically not included.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The proposed method was also tested on relatively large networks. The results indicate that this method is a smart and capable approach towards achieving a global optimal solution. Additionally, considering a specific set of contingencies reduces the number of constraints and variables in the planning problem, thus significantly reducing the solution time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The SC-DCTEP model does not ensure sufficient reliability in real conditions because it does not consider active losses and reactive loading of the transmission network. By modeling the problem based on AC power flow equations, it is possible to fully account for reactive power loading and voltage constraints, thereby achieving adequate system security to handle contingencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Since the cost of constructing reactive power resources is much lower than that of constructing transmission lines, simultaneous planning of the transmission network and reactive power resources leads to both required reliability and the most cost-effective development plan. This conclusion is supported by comparing the results of simultaneous planning with hierarchical approaches, where ignoring reactive power resources often results in reduced transmission capacity and increased need for additional transmission lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. If standards allow transmission lines to operate under contingency conditions up to their short-term thermal loading limits, consumer demand can be met with fewer transmission equipment, thereby reducing investment costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In the modeling done, the network operator's response to contingencies is modeled reactively, but a proactive approach could be considered instead. Adopting a proactive approach may lead to higher investment costs for transmission lines and reactive power resources compared to a reactive approach. This approach would create a trade-off between economic issues and system security.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the modeling and studies conducted in this thesis, the following topics could be considered for future research:\n",
