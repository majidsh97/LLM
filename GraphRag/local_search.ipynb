This cleaning action helps to improve the wetting and flow of the solder, ensuring a strong and reliable bond. Fluxes are typically classified based on their activity level, with low-activity fluxes being preferred for clean boards and high-activity fluxes being used for more challenging applications. The choice of flux depends on the specific soldering process and the materials being joined.  Flux also helps to prevent the formation of oxides during the soldering process, further enhancing the quality of the solder joint.

This process is commonly used in electronics assembly to connect components to printed circuit boards (PCBs).  \\n\\nThere are two main types of soldering processes: wave soldering and selective soldering. Wave soldering uses a wave of molten solder to solder components to a PCB, while selective soldering applies solder to specific areas of a PCB. Soldering processes can be classified by the type of assembly being soldered, such as through-hole or surface mount. Through-hole assemblies involve components inserted through holes in a PCB and soldered on the other side, while surface mount assemblies place components on the surface of a PCB for soldering. \\n\\nSoldering processes can also be classified by the type of heat applied, such as convection, conduction, or infrared. Convection soldering uses heat transferred by convection, conduction soldering uses heat transferred by conduction, and infrared soldering uses heat transferred by infrared radiation. \\n\\nThe soldering process is used in a wide variety of applications, including electronics assembly, automotive manufacturing, and aerospace manufacturing. The quality of a soldering process is crucial for the reliability of the assembled product, as a poorly soldered joint can lead to product failure. Factors affecting the quality of a soldering process include the type of solder used, the solder temperature, the application time, and the cleanliness of the surfaces being soldered. The quality can be assessed through visual inspection, X-ray inspection, and electrical testing. \\n\\nSoldering processes are constantly evolving with the development of new technologies. For example, the development of lead-free solder has led to the creation of new soldering processes compatible with this material. The drive for new soldering processes stems from the need to improve product quality and reliability, as well as to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing processes.\\n\\nIt is important to note that soldering can be a potentially dangerous process due to the use of solvents, flammable materials, and high temperatures. The process can cause lead poisoning, burns, and injuries from moving parts. Therefore, following safety procedures and training is essential to avoid accidents. \\n|31\\n72|COMPARISON OF SOLDERING PROCESSES|Comparison of soldering processes is a process of comparing the different soldering processes|0\\n441|SC SOLDERING|SC soldering is a process used in surface mounting assembly production where solder and flux are applied as a paste followed by the placement of components and the application of heat|7\\n352|WETTING|Wetting is a crucial step in soldering, where the molten solder comes into direct contact with the metal surfaces to be joined.

This is achieved through careful design of products and services used in soldering, as well as adherence to proper safety procedures. \\n|11.0|122|1\\n68|SOLDERING|SURFACE MOUNTED JOINTS|Soldering is a process that is used to create surface mounted joints|5.0|122|1\\n72|SOLDERING|PROTECTIVE COATINGS|Protective coatings are used to improve solderability|5.0|122|1\\n\\n\\n-----Sources-----\\nid|text\\n1|Foreword\\n\\nPreface\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\n1 Soldering process\\n\\nTime on its side\\n\\nPrinted circuit board\\n\\nSoldering\\n\\nSoldering processes\\n\\nComponent/solder (CS) processes\\n\\nSolder/component (SC) processes\\n\\nCleaning\\n\\nQuality\\n\\nSafety\\n\\n2 Electronics assemblies\\n\\nJoints\\n\\nThrough-hole joints\\n\\nSurface mounted components\\n\\nSurface mounted joints\\n\\nAssembly variations\\n\\nAssembly classification\\n\\n3 Solder\\n\\nMetallurgical properties of tin/lead alloys\\n\\nThe soldered joint\\n\\nSolderability\\n\\nProtective coatings\\n\\n4 Lead-free solder\\n\\nWhat\\'s needed in the future?\\n\\nLead-free soldering- now a hot topic!\\n\\nThe age of lead-free soldering is approaching fast\\n\\nITRI\\n\\n5 Flux\\n\\nNeed for flux\\n\\nHow fluxes work\\n\\nCategorization of fluxes\\n\\nChoosing a flux\\n\\nApplication of fluxes\\n\\nSC soldering process flux\\n\\n6 Solder paste\\n\\nSolder paste or adhesive application\\n\\nDispensing\\n\\nPin transfer\\n\\nUsing solder paste\\n\\nSolder paste parameters\\n\\n7 CS soldering processes\\n\\nHand soldering\\n\\nMass CS soldering processes\\n\\nInert atmosphere soldering\\n\\nHandling assemblies\\n\\nSolder pots and pumps\\n\\nSolder pot heaters\\n\\nSoldering\\n\\nSoldering process monitoring\\n\\nvii\\n\\nix\\n\\nxiii\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n5\\n\\n8\\n\\n16\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n21\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n23\\n\\n27\\n\\n35\\n\\n36\\n\\n43\\n\\n49\\n\\n51\\n\\n51\\n\\n56\\n\\n66\\n\\n72\\n\\n81\\n\\n81\\n\\n83\\n\\n87\\n\\n88\\n\\n89\\n\\n9O\\n\\n91\\n\\n92\\n\\n98\\n\\n99\\n\\n107\\n\\n109\\n\\n109\\n\\n118\\n\\n122\\n\\n123\\n\\n124\\n\\n127\\n\\n127\\n\\n134\\n\\n136\\n\\n136\\n\\n146\\n\\n147\\n\\n148\\n\\n163\\n\\nvi\\n\\n8  SC  soldering processes   Heat application   Infra-red soldering   Hot air convection   Hot vapour soldering   Laser soldering   Light beam soldering   Heated collet or hot bar   Miscellaneous SC  soldering processes   Comparison of soldering processes   9   Profiling soldering processes   Profiles   Infra-red soldering temperature profiles   Hot vapour soldering temperature profiles   Heated collet temperature profiles   Optimizing temperature profiles   10   Cleaning soldered assemblies   The Montreal Protocol   Why clean at all?

The first is non-wetting, where part or all ofthe metal to be soldered is devoid   of solder. Usually this occurs where a contaminant or oxide has been left on   the  metal  surface,  so preventing  the  necessary  alloy  bond  between  metal   and  solder  layer.  The  second  is  dewetting,  where  the  alloy  bond  has   occurred,  but  where  the  solder  withdraws  from  the  metal  and  forms   dispersed,  irregular droplets.  Further solder cannot accumulate  due to the   high  surface  tension  formed.  Where  dewetting  occurs,  it  is  sometimes   difficult  to determine;  a simple visual  check  may  not be sufficient.   Both  problems  are  usually  caused  by  lack  of  cleanliness,  although   dewetting can also occur when  large amounts of intermetallic  compounds   form.   Cleaning   There  are  two  areas in  which  cleaning  may  need  to  take  place  in  the   soldering process.  First, the metallic  surfaces to be soldered together must   be perfectly clean,  in order that solder can wet the metals involved. Second,   residues  left  after  soldering  may  need  to  be  removed.  These are  usually   cleaning.  Both  are discussed  in Chapter  I0.   Another pre-assembly area where cleaning  is important,  often out of the   hands of the assembler,  is cleanliness during board manufacture. Where an   assembler  simply  buys-in  ready-made  boards,  problems  of  cleanliness   during  manufacture  may  be difficult  to  isolate,  and  even  more  difficult  to   eliminate.  Cleanliness  of  ready-made  boards  is of vital  importance  when  \\n\\nSOLDERING 13\\n\\nBase material\\n\\nCleaning\\n19|20 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\npreviously  molten  solder.  Further,  soldering  processes can\\'t  be  classified   simply  by  the  two  different  assembly  types  of  through-hole  and  surface   mount designs, because some surface mount assemblies  use CS processes.   Likewise,  it  is feasible - -   though  not currently  usual  - -   for some through-   hole assemblies  to be soldered  by SC means.   As  an  aside  here,  a  growing  number  of  large  manufacturers  such  as   Motorola  and  Hewlett  Packard  are  looking  to  produce  mixed  surface   Figure 1.9  One type   of surface mount   assembly in which   solder is applied,  in the   form of paste,  before   components are placed   in position.

By 1994,  in fact, some intend   to have already implemented this, and will  no longer use CS wave soldering   methods at all.   Mass  SC  soldering  techniques  are  generally  categorized  by  type  and   direction of applied heat. These are all discussed (including through-hole SC   processes) in  Chapter 8.   Cleaning   While  cleanliness of electronics  assemblies  is an asset which  all  manufac-   turers  should  strive for,  never has it been  so important  as in  production  of   modern densely-populated  printed circuit  boards. The smaller the compo-   nents are which  are  located on a printed  circuit  board,  and the closer they   are together, the harder it becomes to ensure they are totally clean after all   manufacturing  processes ~  particularly  soldering.   Environmental  concerns regarding the damage which  certain chemicals   do to the ozone  levels  in earth\\'s atmosphere  has restricted the use of those   chemicals.  In a short time (ie, by the end of the century, say) those chemicals   and  indeed some others which  may have otherwise been considered as   alternatives  ~  will  not  be  available  for  use  at  all  as  cleaning  agents.   Consequently,  manufacturers  need to ensure cleaning agents which  cause   no danger to our environment  are used in  cleaning  processes.   Chapter  10  discusses this  cleaning  dilemma  in  electronics  assembly   manufacture,  and describes all  cleaning  processes.   Quality   Given  that  a  circuit  is  properly  designed,  component  parts are  of  good   quality  and  printed  circuit  boards  are  assembled  correctly,  then  solder   processes  hold  the  fundamental  key  to  an  assembly\\'s  quality.  Modern   machine soldering equipment is capable of tremendous achievement, much   ofwhich  is under automatic control. While things work properly and perfect   zero-defect assembled printed circuit boards are coming off the production   line,  everybody\\'s  happy.   But what happens if things go wrong? How do you tell  if a particular fault   is related specifically to your solder machine or to peripheral equipment and   processes? There are so many variables in production  of electronics assem-   blies  ~  particularly  in  the  soldering  process  part  ~   that  it  is  often  not   possible to  isolate the  problem  and  effect a cure.   Answers are not always easy to come  by and  so for this reason we  have   attempted  to  make  things  just  a  little  less complicated  with  Chapter  11,  \\n15|14 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\ncertain  fluxes  (those with  little  reactional  activity)  are used. Modern  trends   indicate  greater  usage  of  such  fluxes  in  the  future,  so  clean  boards  are   correspondingly  more  important.   Solderable surfaces   Solder will  only  join  certain  surfaces.  Generally,  in  electronics  assembly,   these surfaces are of just one main type of metal\" copper. (Occasionally  iron,   nickel  iron and brass parts are found  in assemblies.) Copper is, of course, an   Photo  1.1  Non-wetting,  showing   where copper surface is not wetted   at all, so surface is visible (Alpha   Metals)   Photo  1.2  Dewetting,  showing   surface which is originally wetted,   followed by withdrawal of solder,   leaving an alloy bond on the   copper surface (Alpha Metals)  \\n\\nSOLDERING  15   extremely good electrical conductor and so is ideal for the purpose.  It does,   however,  oxidize fairly easily in air and  is generally protected  somehow to   prevent  oxidation  (which  may  prevent  soldering  taking  place)  prior  to   soldering.   Ability  of  a  surface  to  be  completely  wet  by  solder  is  scientifically   measured as its solderability and the term is one of the most important in the   subject of soldering.  In other words,  it refers to how well  and  how uniform   the  interfacing  alloy bond  between  solder  and  metal  is made.   It fol lows that solderabil ity is concerned with every\\'aspect of the soldering   process  (ie, fluxing,  wetting,  heating,  cleaning),  and  the  main  aspects  of   board  manufacture,  too  (ie, copper  plating,  tin/lead  plating,  solder  resist   application).  Further,  solderability generally decreases with age, as tarnish-   ing of the  metals  involved  occurs  naturally  in  normal  atmosphere.   One of the major problems of guaranteeing  adequate  solderability  is the   difficulty  in  measuring  exactly what solderability  is.  Not so very long ago,   solder  joint  quality  (and  hence,  solderability  of the  metals  involved)  was   determined  by  an  over-simple  visual  check:  the  joint\\'s  brightness  and   smoothness  was thought an  indicator of joint quality.  Indeed,  it sometimes   still  is.  However,  modern  joints  on  surface  mounted  assemblies,  say,  are   Photo  1.3  A  computer-controlled   solderability  tester (Multicore)  \\n0|6G a®*: s +. i 2 a <, s e Ged SECOND EDITION\\n\\nSoldering in Electronics Assembly\\n\\nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank\\n\\nSoldering in Electronics Assembly   Mike Judd and Keith Brindley   Newnes  \\n\\nNewnes\\n\\nNewnes An imprint of Butterworth-Heinemann Linacre House, Jordan Hill, Oxford OX2 8DP 225 Wildwood Avenue, Woburn, MA 01801-2041 A division of Reed Educationa and Professional Publishing Ltd RQ A member of the Reed Elsevier plc group First published 1992 Second edition 1999 © Mike Judd & Keith Brindley 1992, 1999 All rights reserved.

It is, indeed,  a   simple process of bringing parts to be joined together with  solder, flux and   heat.  How  to do this and to achieve a satisfactory  result, though,  is both  a   science and an art, when each by itself may vary. Methods and the principle   used as years go by form  a most fascinating  subject.   Bob Willis,  Electronic Presentation Services   Solder is truly a magnificent trifle, it gets little respect from  management   yet it holds the entire electronics industry together. Thus another book on   soldering  is very welcome!   Howard  H  Manko,  Manko Associates   After nearly 4000 years, soldering  remains  as much  an art as a science.   Progress is still accelerating in this field of electronic technology, forcing us   m  again and  again m  to  rethink the  idea of quality.   Soldering first forged weapons, but now it may help us develop intelligent   machines towards  assisting  mankind  in  peaceful  pursuits.   Armin  Rahn,  rahn-tec Consultants   The more we know about soldering electronics assemblies,  the more we   discover  what  we  don\\'t  know.  We  may argue about the  best solder fillet   shapes, the  benefits  of  controlling  the  solder  joint  microstructure,  or  the   required cleanliness  level of flux residues, but it is the practice of soldering   that is of the essence: almost anyone can solder - -   but few can solder well.   Colin  Lea, National Physical Laboratory   Printed  wiring  boards are the primary  means  of  interconnecting  circuit   components.  As  such  they  have  contributed  greatly  to  the  growth  of   electronics.  Assembly  and  connection  of  printed  wiring  b o a r d s -   also   called  printed  circuits  and  etched  w i r i n g -    involve  a sequence  of three   basic operations.  They are (1) manual  or automatic  insertion  of electronic   components,  (2)  metallurgical  joining  (soldering)  of  component  leads  or   terminals  to  printed  conductors,  and,  usually  (3)  a cleaning  operation  to   remove flux  and other  residual  contaminants.   In  view  of  the  interest  of  electronic  equipment  manufacturers  in  this   subject  and  the  increasing  importance  of  electronics  in  industry  and   elsewhere, a review of the state of the art as it currently exists and discussion   of the effects  of recent developments  in the field  are  in order.   Paul Bud (October  1980),  then  Vice President of Electrovert Inc  \\n2|TIME ON ITS SIDE 3\\n\\nmake up the circuit of an assembly and component leads are soldered to the   copper,  so that  mechanical  and  electrical  support  is  provided  with  each   solder joint.  Note that,  in this ideal joint,  solder has been drawn  inside the   hole during the soldering operation mthis occurs by capillary action. Solder   between  the copper track  and the component  lead  is called  the fillet.   Emergence of a different type of electronics assembly m  surface mounted   assemblies or SMAs ~  however,  is altering the face of soldering processes   used. So much  is surface mount technology (SMT) changing soldering that,   at present, somewhere around 50% of all electronics assemblies use at least   a  few  surface mounted components (SMCs ~  also  sometimes  called   surface mounted devices or SMDs). In 1980 the figure was, to all practical   purposes outside  of Japan, zero. This  change  in  assembly technology  has   only  been  possible  with  developments  bringing  a  parallel  change  in   soldering technology. Changes in component technology, too, are pushing   many  companies  along the  surface  mount  route ~  a growing  number  of   components simply cannot be obtained in through-hole forms and are only   available  as surface mounted  components.

Differ-   ence  between  this  and  the  through-hole  assembly  joint  of  Figure  1.1  is   immediately  a p p a r e n t -   surface  mounted  assemblies  do  not  use holes to   locate component  leads prior to soldering.  Indeed,  surface mounted  com-   ponents do  not have  leads, a fact which  prompts  another descriptive term   for them  - -   leadless components - -   in  contrast with  components  used  in   through-hole assemblies which are often called leaded components. While   we\\'re  defining  terms,  we  may  as  well  go  on  to  point  out  where  leaded   components  are  inserted into a printed  circuit board,  leadless  components   are  loosely said  to  be  onserted onto  a  board.   From  this  description  it\\'s  easy  to  see  that  surface  mount  technology  is   based  on  a  marriage  of  standard  through-hole  techniques  with  hybrid   assembly  techniques  (hybrid  assemblies  are  those  in  which  film-based   components  are combined with  ieadless discrete components on a ceramic   or similar  substrate).   These  two  main  assembly  types  are  only  categories,  and  within  each   category there are many variations, each with specific solder joint concerns   and requirements.  Relevant variations,  joint types and solder processes are   detailed  in Chapter 2.

In its simplest form, soldering is uncomplicated. Production of a soldered joint requires only that the parts to be soldered are positioned to remain relatively immobile. The surfaces are then heated to allow coverage with molten solder, and the solder is allowed to cool and solidify. However, controlling this process are five variables: @ flux @ wetting @ heat @ solderable surfaces @ time. Flux In most cases, a substance called flux is used in the process, primarily to clean thesurfaces to be soldered and so aid wetting. However clean they are, all metals (with the exception of the noble metals) oxidize to form an oxide layer on their surfaces. Other tarnish products may occur, too. Presence of any tarnish layer will prevent wetting. Flux reacts with the tarnish layers, leaving a pure base metal surface for the solder to wet. A secondary function of the flux is to reduce the solder’s surface tension, so increasing the solder fluidity and aiding wetting. Another is to protect the metal surface during subsequent heating. Heat Application of heat is a prime requirement of any soldering process: solder has a melting point of, typically, around 185 °C. So, to enable its application, the solder has to be heated to at least this temperature. This can be done, in the three extremes, by: @ heating the joint before solid solder is applied (for example, when hand soldering) @ heating the solder until molten before application to the joint (say, in wave soldering) @ applying solder to the joint, then heating both (say, simple infra-red soldering techniques). While techniques exist formed by just one of the three extremes, many\\n26|1 Soldering process This chapter could be seen as just another introduction to soldering — it does, after all, explain in a fairly basic manner all important aspects of soldering in electronics assemblies. In this light many people may be tempted to skip it. However, this would be a mistake as it also explains philosophy behind the complete book. Further, it discusses main features and illustrates fundamental premises upon which we have based our text. Finally it also serves as a guide indicating where relevant and important information is to be found within the rest of the book. We strongly advise this chapter is looked at bearing all this in mind. Soldering, in principle though not in practice, is a reasonably straightfor- ward process, used in the electronics industry to bond components to- gether, forming one or more electrical connections. From this description, it’s easy to see that soldering serves two functions: @ mechanical support — holding components of an assembly together @ electrical support — forming required electrical connections within a circuit. Most components in an assembly use the mechanical support of soldered joints alone to give adequate fixing into the assembly. A few isolated components (notably, larger, heavier components) may require additional mechanical support, in the form of straps, nuts, bolts and so on. Where possible, however, such large components should be designed out (that is, care should be taken when designing a circuit not to use such components) of an assembly to keep extra procedures and cost to a minimum. On the other hand, all components may use solder as electrical support to form required electrical connections. No other method has yet been devised to take the place of solder in all assemblies to the same level of performance, cost and ease of operation.\\n\\n\\n\\n---Goal---\\n\\nGiven a series of example questions provided by the user, generate a bulleted list of 5 candidates for the next question.
