WizardLM is trained on a large dataset of instructions generated by an AI system called Evol-Instruct. Evol-Instruct creates complex instructions by gradually rewriting simpler ones. The researchers found that instructions generated by Evol-Instruct are better than those created by humans. WizardLM outperforms OpenAI's ChatGPT in some tasks, demonstrating the potential of AI-evolved instructions for improving LLMs. The code and data for WizardLM are publicly available. \n","chunk_id":"549cbdab243ec14b81159f81ef265cf8","document_ids":["0ba1e80003cc042de01bd5cfd470fbd2"],"n_tokens":110,"entities":[],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\" \/><\/graphml>"}
