Comparison of soldering processes All SC soldering processes are compared in Appendix 4, along with CS soldering processes.\n\nPreface   Electronics assembly is about components that are soldered onto a printed   circuit board.  Soldering, as a principle  in electronics assembly, is straight-   forward  and simple m  two  metal surfaces (component termination  and a   connecting pad on printed circuit board track) are joined by metallic bonds   created by molten solder between them. Solder joints are supported by the   solder when  it solidifies,  and the solder allows electrical  contact between   metals in the joints.  Surface mounted components are changing, they are   becoming  smaller  and  lighter and  in the case of ICs due to the  increased   demands of functionality,  they also  have a greater number of  leads. This   dimensional  and  weight  change  is  driven  by  the  increase in  demand  of   portable  products.  Table  I  shows the  growth  in  unit  terms for  portable   products over the coming years.   The other sectors illustrated  harsh environment,  low cost/high value and   high  performance  cut across the traditional  market  boundaries and focus   more on the products technology requirement (Figure I).   Increasingly,  a number of companies are adopting one particular pack-   aging strategy m  that of small form-factor  components  ideal  for  portable   products.  These are  increasingly  being  used in  larger electronic  systems   such as exchanges, base stations etc  as a company  wishes to  adopt one   packaging strategy and hence assembly strategy for all types of products that   they manufacture.  This has obvious benefits with  regards to stock holding   Table  1 Total equipment quantities by global technology roadmap sectors 1997-2007   1997   2 0 0 2    2 0 0 7    x  lO 6   %   x  l O  6   %   x  lO 6   1710   4480   57.2   Portables   45.1   7480   %   !   63.3   High performance   460   12.2   840   10.7   990   8.4   Harsh environment   275   7.3   670   8.6   1190   10.0   Low cost, high volume   1340   35.4   1840   23.5   2160   18.3   Total   3785   1 0 0 . 0   7830   1 0 0 . 0    1 1 8 2 0   100.0\n######################\nOutput:"
