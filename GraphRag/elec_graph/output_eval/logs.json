Construction of these printed circuit\nboards is critical to soldering processes in that different printed circuit\nboard types have different thermal characteristics which can greatly affect\nhow they must be soldered.\nIn principle a printed circuit board (PCB) sometimes called a printed\nwiring board (PWB) or simply printed board comprises: a base which is\na thin board of insulating material supporting all the components which\nmake up a circuit; conducting tracks usually copper on one or bOth sides\nof the base making up the interconnections between components. Component\nconnecting leads are electrically connected in some form of permanent\nor semi-permanent way usually by soldering to lands sometimes called\npads ~ the areas of track specially designated for component connection\npurposes. If lands have holes drilled or punched through the board to\nfacilitate component mounting the board is a through-hole printed circuit\nboard. If lands have no holes the board is a surface mounted printed circuit\nboard.\nTo clarify the term printed is somewhat misleading as tracks are not\nprinted directly onto the board. It refers instead to just one stage within the\nwhole printed circuit board manufacturing process where the conducting\ntrack layout sometimes called pattern or image may be produced using\nsome form of printing technique.\nPrinted circuit boards can be made in one of two main ways. First in an\nadditive process the conductive track may be added to the surface of the\nbase material. There's a number of ways in which this can be done. Second\nin a subtractive process where base material is supplied with its whole\nsurface covered with a conductive layer track pattern is defined and excess\nconductive material is removed leaving the required track. Sometimes\nboth processes may be combined to produce printed circuit boards with\nmore than one layer of conductive track.\n######################\nOutput:"
