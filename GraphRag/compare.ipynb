This cleaning action helps to improve the wetting and flow of the solder, ensuring a strong and reliable bond. Fluxes are typically classified based on their activity level, with low-activity fluxes being preferred for clean boards and high-activity fluxes being used for more challenging applications. The choice of flux depends on the specific soldering process and the materials being joined.  Flux also helps to prevent the formation of oxides during the soldering process, further enhancing the quality of the solder joint.  It reacts with tarnish layers, leaving a pure base metal surface for the solder to wet. Additionally, flux reduces the solder's surface tension, increasing fluidity and aiding wetting. \n",

      "SOLDERING 11 Requirements of the soldering process There are a few important points to be understood when studying the soldering process. In its simplest form, soldering is uncomplicated. Production of a soldered joint requires only that the parts to be soldered are positioned to remain relatively immobile. The surfaces are then heated to allow coverage with molten solder, and the solder is allowed to cool and solidify. However, controlling this process are five variables: @ flux @ wetting @ heat @ solderable surfaces @ time. Flux In most cases, a substance called flux is used in the process, primarily to clean thesurfaces to be soldered and so aid wetting. However clean they are, all metals (with the exception of the noble metals) oxidize to form an oxide layer on their surfaces. Other tarnish products may occur, too. Presence of any tarnish layer will prevent wetting. Flux reacts with the tarnish layers, leaving a pure base metal surface for the solder to wet. A secondary function of the flux is to reduce the solder’s surface tension, so increasing the solder fluidity and aiding wetting. Another is to protect the metal surface during subsequent heating. Heat Application of heat is a prime requirement of any soldering process: solder has a melting point of, typically, around 185 °C. So, to enable its application, the solder has to be heated to at least this temperature. This can be done, in the three extremes, by: @ heating the joint before solid solder is applied (for example, when hand soldering) @ heating the solder until molten before application to the joint (say, in wave soldering) @ applying solder to the joint, then heating both (say, simple infra-red soldering techniques). While techniques exist formed by just one of the three extremes, many\n",

      "18 SOLDERING PROCESS Figure 1.6 A simple form of dip soldering — lowering and remov- ing the printed circuit board near- horizontally Component/solder (CS) processes There are three main CS soldering processes: @ dip soldering @ drag soldering @ wave soldering. Dip soldering in dip soldering processes the assembled board is fluxed then lowered near- horizontally, into a bath of molten solder as shown in Figure 1.6. Once the lower edge of the board comes into contact with the solder, the board is dropped to a horizontal position on top of the solder. After a suitable period during which the solder achieves wetting over the whole of the areas to be soldered, one edge of the board is lifted (usually the edge which first came into contact with the solder), then the whole board is lifted clear of the bath. Dip soldering suffers from problems in that flux gases are easily trapped under the board and, as a consequence, contact times must be quite tong {about 10 seconds) to ensure adequate wetting and solder temperature must be quite high. Solder Drag soldering By dragging the assembled and fluxed board over the surface of molten solder (illustrated in Figure 1.7), the problems associated with dip soldering processes can be overcome. Consequent contact times are much shorter (about 5 seconds). Wave soldering Wave soldering processes use a pump to create a wave of solder over which the assembled and fluxed board is passed (illustrated in Figure 1.8). Contact times of only 2 to 4 seconds are usual, and required solder temperature is lowered.\n",

      "Figure 1.5   If a  contaminant such   as oxide  is present on  the metal   surface prior to soldering,  no   intermetallic compound  is formed   so wetting  cannot take place   In context with the wetting of metals, two other terms need to be defined.   The first is non-wetting, where part or all ofthe metal to be soldered is devoid   of solder. Usually this occurs where a contaminant or oxide has been left on   the  metal  surface,  so preventing  the  necessary  alloy  bond  between  metal   and  solder  layer.  The  second  is  dewetting,  where  the  alloy  bond  has   occurred,  but  where  the  solder  withdraws  from  the  metal  and  forms   dispersed,  irregular droplets.  Further solder cannot accumulate  due to the   high  surface  tension  formed.  Where  dewetting  occurs,  it  is  sometimes   difficult  to determine;  a simple visual  check  may  not be sufficient.   Both  problems  are  usually  caused  by  lack  of  cleanliness,  although   dewetting can also occur when  large amounts of intermetallic  compounds   form.   Cleaning   There  are  two  areas in  which  cleaning  may  need  to  take  place  in  the   soldering process.  First, the metallic  surfaces to be soldered together must   be perfectly clean,  in order that solder can wet the metals involved. Second,   residues  left  after  soldering  may  need  to  be  removed.  These are  usually   cleaning.  Both  are discussed  in Chapter  I0.   Another pre-assembly area where cleaning  is important,  often out of the   hands of the assembler,  is cleanliness during board manufacture. Where an   assembler  simply  buys-in  ready-made  boards,  problems  of  cleanliness   during  manufacture  may  be difficult  to  isolate,  and  even  more  difficult  to   eliminate.  Cleanliness  of  ready-made  boards  is of vital  importance  when  \n",

It does,   however,  oxidize fairly easily in air and  is generally protected  somehow to   prevent  oxidation  (which  may  prevent  soldering  taking  place)  prior  to   soldering.   Ability  of  a  surface  to  be  completely  wet  by  solder  is  scientifically   measured as its solderability and the term is one of the most important in the   subject of soldering.  In other words,  it refers to how well  and  how uniform   the  interfacing  alloy bond  between  solder  and  metal  is made.   It fol lows that solderabil ity is concerned with every'aspect of the soldering   process  (ie, fluxing,  wetting,  heating,  cleaning),  and  the  main  aspects  of   board  manufacture,  too  (ie, copper  plating,  tin/lead  plating,  solder  resist   application).  Further,  solderability generally decreases with age, as tarnish-   ing of the  metals  involved  occurs  naturally  in  normal  atmosphere.   One of the major problems of guaranteeing  adequate  solderability  is the   difficulty  in  measuring  exactly what solderability  is.  Not so very long ago,   solder  joint  quality  (and  hence,  solderability  of the  metals  involved)  was   determined  by  an  over-simple  visual  check:  the  joint's  brightness  and   smoothness  was thought an  indicator of joint quality.  Indeed,  it sometimes   still  is.  However,  modern  joints  on  surface  mounted  assemblies,  say,  are   Photo  1.3  A  computer-controlled   solderability  tester (Multicore)  \n",
