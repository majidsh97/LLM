Lead on, Spirit!\\'\\n\\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\\nalong.\\n\\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\\nwere in the heart of it; on \\'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried\\nup and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their\\ngreat gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\\n\\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\\ntalk.\\n\\n\\'No,\\' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, \\'I don\\'t know much\\nabout it either way. I only know he\\'s dead.\\'\\n\\n\\'When did he die?\\' inquired another.\\n\\n\\'Last night, I believe.\\'\\n\\n\\'Why, what was the matter with him?\\' asked a third, taking a vast\\nquantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. \\'I thought he\\'d never\\ndie.\\'\\n\\n\\'God knows,\\' said the first, with a yawn.\\n\\n\\'What has he done with his money?\\' asked a red-faced gentleman with a\\npendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills\\nof a turkey-cock.\\n\\n\\'I haven\\'t heard,\\' said the man with the large chin, yawning again.\\n\\'Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn\\'t left it to _me_. That\\'s all\\nI know.\\'\\n\\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s likely to be a very cheap funeral,\\' said the same speaker; \\'for,\\nupon my life, I don\\'t know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a\\nparty, and volunteer?\\'\\n\\n\\'I don\\'t mind going if a lunch is provided,\\' observed the gentleman with\\nthe excrescence on his nose. \\'But I must be fed if I make one.\\'\\n\\nAnother laugh.\\n\\n[Illustration:\\n\\n  _\"How are you?\" said one.\\n   \"How are you?\" returned the other.\\n   \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"_\\n\\n]\\n\\n\\'Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,\\' said the first\\nspeaker, \\'for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But I\\'ll\\noffer to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I\\'m not\\nat all sure that I wasn\\'t his most particular friend; for we used to\\nstop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!\\'\\n\\nSpeakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups.\\nScrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\\n\\nThe phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons\\nmeeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie\\nhere.\\n\\nHe knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business: very\\nwealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point always of standing\\nwell in their esteem in a business point of view, that is; strictly in a\\nbusiness point of view.\\n\\n\\'How are you?\\' said one.\\n\\n\\'How are you?\\' returned the other.\\n\\n\\'Well!\\' said the first, \\'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\\'\\n\\n\\'So I am told,\\' returned the second. \\'Cold, isn\\'t it?\\'\\n\\n\\'Seasonable for Christmas-time. You are not a skater, I suppose?\\'\\n\\n\\'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!\\'\\n\\nNot another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their\\nparting.\\n\\nScrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should\\nattach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling\\nassured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to\\nconsider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to\\nhave any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was\\nPast, and this Ghost\\'s province was the Future. Nor could he think of\\nany one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them.\\nBut nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some\\nlatent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every\\nword he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the\\nshadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation that the\\nconduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would\\nrender the solution of these riddles easy.\\n\\nHe looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man\\nstood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his\\nusual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among\\nthe multitudes that poured in through the Porch. It gave him little\\nsurprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of\\nlife, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out\\nin this.\\n\\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\\nand feel very cold.\\n\\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\\nwhere Scro', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.2923593701747352), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='080d8e696ff38c653ca90fa086415e74', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='\\'Bah!\\' again; and followed it up with \\'Humbug!\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be cross, uncle!\\' said the nephew.\\n\\n\\'What else can I be,\\' returned the uncle, \\'when I live in such a world\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\\'s\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \\'em through a round dozen\\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\\' said\\nScrooge indignantly, \\'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\"\\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\\'\\n\\n\\'Uncle!\\' pleaded the nephew.\\n\\n\\'Nephew!\\' returned the uncle sternly, \\'keep Christmas in your own way,\\nand let me keep it in mine.\\'\\n\\n\\'Keep it!\\' repeated Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'But you don\\'t keep it.\\'\\n\\n\\'Let me leave it alone, then,\\' said Scrooge. \\'Much good may it do you!\\nMuch good it has ever done you!\\'\\n\\n\\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\\nhave not profited, I dare say,\\' returned the nephew; \\'Christmas among\\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\\nbless it!\\'\\n\\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\\nlast frail spark for ever.\\n\\n\\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\\' said Scrooge, \\'and you\\'ll keep\\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\\'re quite a powerful\\nspeaker, sir,\\' he added, turning to his nephew. \\'I wonder you don\\'t go\\ninto Parliament.\\'\\n\\n\\'Don\\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\\'\\n\\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\\nextremity first.\\n\\n\\'But why?\\' cried Scrooge\\'s nephew. \\'Why?\\'\\n\\n\\'Why did you get married?\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'Because I fell in love.\\'\\n\\n\\'Because you fell in love!\\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \\'Good\\nafternoon!\\'\\n\\n\\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\\nit as a reason for not coming now?\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\\nfriends?\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon!\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\\nin homage to Christmas, and I\\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon,\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\n\\'And A Happy New Year!\\'\\n\\n\\'Good afternoon!\\' said Scrooge.\\n\\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\\nthem cordially.\\n\\n\\'There\\'s another fellow,\\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \\'my\\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\\nabout a merry Christmas. I\\'ll retire to Bedlam.\\'\\n\\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\\'s nephew out, had let two other people\\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\\'s office. They had books and papers in their\\nhands, and bowed to him.\\n\\n\\'Scrooge and Marley\\'s, I believe,\\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\\nto his list. \\'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\\nMarley?\\'\\n\\n\\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\\' Scrooge replied. \\'He died\\nseven years ago, this very night.\\'\\n\\n\\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\\npartner,\\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\\n\\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\\n\\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\\nword \\'liberality\\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\\ncredentials back.\\n\\n\\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scro', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.2889239410776775)], metadata={'ebc403dd3df39bacc3443ef4afb7edfd': {}, '080d8e696ff38c653ca90fa086415e74': {}})"

Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that\\nnothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did\\nnot have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as\\nthese would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less\\nattractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for\\nhim.\\n\\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the\\nTotal-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of\\nhim that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed\\nthe knowledge.

There is no doubt whatever about that.\\nThe register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the\\nundertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge\\'s name\\nwas good upon \\'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\\n\\nMind! I don\\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\\'s done for. You\\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\\ndead as a door-nail.\\n\\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\\'t know how many years. Scrooge\\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\\nit with an undoubted bargain.\\n\\nThe mention of Marley\\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\\'s father died\\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\\'s Churchyard, for\\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\\'s weak mind.\\n\\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\\'s name. There it stood, years\\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\\nwas all the same to him.\\n\\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his',\n",

       "   {'text': \" then\\nremembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as\\ndragging chains.\\n\\nThe cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the\\nnoise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then\\ncoming straight towards his door.\\n\\n'It's humbug still!' said Scrooge. 'I won't believe it.'\\n\\nHis colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through\\nthe heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its coming\\nin, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's\\nGhost!' and fell again.\\n\\nThe same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,\\ntights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his\\npigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head. The chain he\\ndrew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like\\na tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes,\\nkeys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel. His\\nbody was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking\\nthrough his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\\n\\nScrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had\\nnever believed it until now.\\n\\nNo, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through\\nand through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling\\ninfluence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the\\nfolded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not\\nobserved before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his\\nsenses.\\n\\n'How now!' said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. 'What do you want\\nwith me?'\\n\\n'Much!'--Marley's voice; no doubt about it.\\n\\n'Who are you?'\\n\\n'Ask me who I _was_.'\\n\\n'Who _were_ you, then?' said Scrooge, raising his voice. 'You're\\nparticular, for a shade.' He was going to say '_to_ a shade,' but\\nsubstituted this, as more appropriate.\\n\\n'In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.'\\n\\n'Can you--can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\\n\\n'I can.'\\n\\n'Do it, then.'\\n\\nScrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so\\ntransparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt\\nthat in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the\\nnecessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the\\nopposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.\\n\\n'You don't believe in me,' observed the Ghost.\\n\\n'I don't,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own\\nsenses?'\\n\\n'I don't know,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'Why do you doubt your senses?'\\n\\n'Because,' said Scrooge, 'a little thing affects them. A slight disorder\\nof the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef,\\na blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato.\\nThere's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!'\\n\\nScrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in\\nhis heart by any means waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be\\nsmart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his\\nterror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.\\n\\nTo sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment,\\nwould play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. There was something\\nvery awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal\\natmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was\\nclearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its\\nhair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour\\nfrom an oven.\\n\\n'You see this toothpick?' said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge,\\nfor the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a\\nsecond, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\\n\\n'I do,' replied the Ghost.\\n\\n'You are not looking at it,' said Scrooge.\\n\\n'But I see it,' said the Ghost, 'notwithstanding.'\\n\\n'Well!' returned Scrooge, 'I have but to swallow this, and be for the\\nrest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own\\ncreation. Humbug, I tell you: humbug!'\\n\\nAt this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such\\na dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair,\\nto save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his\\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\\nbreast!\\n\\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\\n\\n'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\\n\\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied\",\n",

We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\\nput you down for?'\\n\\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\\n\\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\\n\\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\\nbadly off must go there.'\\n\\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\\n\\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\\ndecrease the surplus population.

Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\\n\\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\\n\\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\\n\\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such\\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\\nbut, at the first sound of\\n\\n  'God bless you, merry gentleman,\\n  May nothing you dismay!'\\n\\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\\nfrost.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "   {'text': \"-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\\ndog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\\n\\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'\\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\\n\\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My\\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars\\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\\nsaid, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'\\n\\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.\\n\\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\\nand was brewing on a large scale.\\n\\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his\\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire\\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't\\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\\n\\n'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was\\nthe voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\\n\\n'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'\\n\\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\\n\\n'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean\\nthat, I am sure?'\\n\\n'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'\\n\\n'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be\\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'\\n\\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\\n'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'\\n\\n'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.\\n\\n'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world\\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\\nbalancing your books\",\n",
