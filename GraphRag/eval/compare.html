Different wave shapes are used for different applications, depending on the size and type of components being soldered. Some common wave shapes include:<br><br>* **Symmetrical wave:** This is the simplest wave shape, and it is often used for through-hole components. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_112 (152)]<br>* **Asymmetrical wave:** This wave shape is more complex and is often used for surface-mount components. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_112 (152)]<br>* **Supported asymmetrical wave:** This wave shape is similar to the asymmetrical wave, but it has a support plate that helps to create a smoother and more consistent wave. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_114 (154)]<br>* **Jet wave:** This wave shape is created by pumping a small amount of solder through a narrow nozzle, which creates a hollow peak over which the assembly is conveyed. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_115 (158)]<br>* **Omega wave:** This wave shape is created by using an electromagnetic transducer to impart controlled vibrations to a supported asymmetrical wave. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_115 (158)]<br><br>### Soldering Process Variables<br><br>There are several variables that can affect the quality of the solder joints in wave soldering. These variables include:<br><br>* **Solder temperature:** The temperature of the molten solder must be carefully controlled to ensure that the solder melts properly and flows smoothly. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_108 (148)]<br>* **Flux:** Flux is a chemical that is used to clean the surfaces of the components and the PCB before soldering. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_108 (148)]<br>* **Preheating:** Preheating the PCB before soldering can help to prevent thermal shock and improve the quality of the solder joints. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_98 (134)]<br>* **Conveyor speed:** The speed at which the PCB is conveyed over the solder wave can affect the amount of time that the solder has to wet the surfaces. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_114 (154)]<br>* **Exit angle:** The angle at which the PCB leaves the solder wave can affect the amount of excess solder that is left on the board. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_112 (152)]<br>* **Contact area:** The area of contact between the PCB and the solder wave can affect the amount of time that the solder has to wet the surfaces. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_112 (152)]<br><br>### Inert Atmosphere Soldering<br><br>Inert atmosphere soldering is a variation of wave soldering that uses an inert gas, such as nitrogen, to create an oxygen-free environment. This helps to prevent oxidation of the solder and the components, which can improve the quality of the solder joints. [Data: Source unit_text soldering.pdf_116 (159)]<br><br>### Advantages and Disadvantages<br><br>Wave soldering has several advantages, including:<br><br>* **High production rate:** Wave soldering is a very efficient process that can be used to solder large numbers of PCBs quickly.
