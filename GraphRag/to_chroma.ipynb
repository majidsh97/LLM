Not many years ago there were no computers, no CDs, no mobile   telecommunications,  and space travel was limited to science fiction --even   radio  networks  have  really  only  grown  up within  a lifetime.  Much  of the   technology  advances  of  our  age  have  been  made  possible  thanks  to  the   innovation  of the electronics  industry which,  with  its development of new   materials,  machines  and techniques,  continues  to grow on a global  basis.   We tend to take such things for granted,  but now developing countries too   are sharing in the electronics  boom.   With  further  miniaturisation,  increased  board  complexity  and  quality   becoming even more critical, expertise in soldering assembly is a prerequi-   site, for both  engineers and  new  recruits to the electronics  business.   Soldering  in  electronics  assembly  is  a  complex  skill,  relying  on  the   combination  of personal  expertise,  quality  materials,  and efficient  equip-   ment.  Quality  management  systems have  helped  raise the  production   yields,  while  equipment  and  materials  technologies  continue  to  keep   abreast of the industry requirements.  But behind all this are the engineers   and  it's they,  working  with  their suppliers,  who  are the  key players  in the   growth  of our  industry  in the future.   This book  is written to provide a useful  reference for engineers involved   with  the practical  side of electronics  assembly operations,  and will  prove   interesting for a wide range of readers, in the broadest sectors of our industry.

Comparison of soldering processes All SC soldering processes are compared in Appendix 4, along with CS soldering processes.\\n\\nPreface   Electronics assembly is about components that are soldered onto a printed   circuit board.  Soldering, as a principle  in electronics assembly, is straight-   forward  and simple m  two  metal surfaces (component termination  and a   connecting pad on printed circuit board track) are joined by metallic bonds   created by molten solder between them. Solder joints are supported by the   solder when  it solidifies,  and the solder allows electrical  contact between   metals in the joints.  Surface mounted components are changing, they are   becoming  smaller  and  lighter and  in the case of ICs due to the  increased   demands of functionality,  they also  have a greater number of  leads. This   dimensional  and  weight  change  is  driven  by  the  increase in  demand  of   portable  products.  Table  I  shows the  growth  in  unit  terms for  portable   products over the coming years.   The other sectors illustrated  harsh environment,  low cost/high value and   high  performance  cut across the traditional  market  boundaries and focus   more on the products technology requirement (Figure I).   Increasingly,  a number of companies are adopting one particular pack-   aging strategy m  that of small form-factor  components  ideal  for  portable   products.  These are  increasingly  being  used in  larger electronic  systems   such as exchanges, base stations etc  as a company  wishes to  adopt one   packaging strategy and hence assembly strategy for all types of products that   they manufacture.  This has obvious benefits with  regards to stock holding   Table  1 Total equipment quantities by global technology roadmap sectors 1997-2007   1997   2 0 0 2    2 0 0 7    x  lO 6   %   x  l O  6   %   x  lO 6   1710   4480   57.2   Portables   45.1   7480   %   !   63.3   High performance   460   12.2   840   10.7   990   8.4   Harsh environment   275   7.3   670   8.6   1190   10.0   Low cost, high volume   1340   35.4   1840   23.5   2160   18.3   Total   3785   1 0 0 . 0   7830   1 0 0 . 0    1 1 8 2 0   100.0  ', \"x PREFACE\\n\\nFigure 1  Global technology   roadmaps (BPA, 1998)   and handling of parts as well as set up time for assembly equipment such as   pick and place machines.

There  are  many  instances  where,  particularly  with  through   hole connectors,  these older technology products will  remain  due to costs   or  robustness.   Small  components  and  greater  lead  counts  make  soldering  to  printed   circuit  boards  more  and  more  difficult.  New  soldering  techniques  and   modifications  of existing techniques  are required to meet the challenge of   smaller surface  mount  and  minimalist  packages.   Our  job  in  writing  this  book  is to  show  all  this.  While  looking  at  the   principle of soldering, which has remained fixed since man first used molten   metal to join two other metals (first known use of solder is Roman pipework,   where sections of lead pipe were joined by melting their ends together),  we   also show  how  the techniques  to fulfill  the  soldering  process  can  change   and,  indeed,  are changing  with  the  requirements  placed  by  components   and printed  circuit  board  assemblies on them.   More than anything else these days (and in the future), state of component   and printed circuit board technologies means soldering has to be clean and   precise. In the distant past, when components were huge and printed circuit   board  tracks  were wide,  soldering was often  a case of throwing  sufficient   molten  solder  at a board  to  make  an  adequate  joint.  Joints  were  initially   made  by  hand.  This  is  no  longer  the  case.  With  minute  component   terminations  and tracks, too much  solder can be devastating. On the other   hand,  too  little  solder  will  not  make  a  joint  at  all.  Even  if  economic   considerations  were not important,  joints  can  no longer be made  by hand   because hand soldering cannot guarantee  adequate results with such small   joints. Control of soldering systems has to be precise and closely monitored.   Soldering and,  inevitably,  its control  must be performed  by machines.   While  it's  impossible  to  summarize  all  we  have  to  say, in  this  short   preface,  it  is possible to  make  a  list of  points  which  our  book,  hopefully,   spotlights.

It is, indeed,  a   simple process of bringing parts to be joined together with  solder, flux and   heat.  How  to do this and to achieve a satisfactory  result, though,  is both  a   science and an art, when each by itself may vary. Methods and the principle   used as years go by form  a most fascinating  subject.   Bob Willis,  Electronic Presentation Services   Solder is truly a magnificent trifle, it gets little respect from  management   yet it holds the entire electronics industry together. Thus another book on   soldering  is very welcome!   Howard  H  Manko,  Manko Associates   After nearly 4000 years, soldering  remains  as much  an art as a science.   Progress is still accelerating in this field of electronic technology, forcing us   m  again and  again m  to  rethink the  idea of quality.   Soldering first forged weapons, but now it may help us develop intelligent   machines towards  assisting  mankind  in  peaceful  pursuits.   Armin  Rahn,  rahn-tec Consultants   The more we know about soldering electronics assemblies,  the more we   discover  what  we  don't  know.  We  may argue about the  best solder fillet   shapes, the  benefits  of  controlling  the  solder  joint  microstructure,  or  the   required cleanliness  level of flux residues, but it is the practice of soldering   that is of the essence: almost anyone can solder - -   but few can solder well.   Colin  Lea, National Physical Laboratory   Printed  wiring  boards are the primary  means  of  interconnecting  circuit   components.  As  such  they  have  contributed  greatly  to  the  growth  of   electronics.  Assembly  and  connection  of  printed  wiring  b o a r d s -   also   called  printed  circuits  and  etched  w i r i n g -    involve  a sequence  of three   basic operations.  They are (1) manual  or automatic  insertion  of electronic   components,  (2)  metallurgical  joining  (soldering)  of  component  leads  or   terminals  to  printed  conductors,  and,  usually  (3)  a cleaning  operation  to   remove flux  and other  residual  contaminants.   In  view  of  the  interest  of  electronic  equipment  manufacturers  in  this   subject  and  the  increasing  importance  of  electronics  in  industry  and   elsewhere, a review of the state of the art as it currently exists and discussion   of the effects  of recent developments  in the field  are  in order.   Paul Bud (October  1980),  then  Vice President of Electrovert Inc  \", '1 Soldering process This chapter could be seen as just another introduction to soldering — it does, after all, explain in a fairly basic manner all important aspects of soldering in electronics assemblies. In this light many people may be tempted to skip it. However, this would be a mistake as it also explains philosophy behind the complete book. Further, it discusses main features and illustrates fundamental premises upon which we have based our text. Finally it also serves as a guide indicating where relevant and important information is to be found within the rest of the book. We strongly advise this chapter is looked at bearing all this in mind. Soldering, in principle though not in practice, is a reasonably straightfor- ward process, used in the electronics industry to bond components to- gether, forming one or more electrical connections. From this description, it’s easy to see that soldering serves two functions: @ mechanical support — holding components of an assembly together @ electrical support — forming required electrical connections within a circuit. Most components in an assembly use the mechanical support of soldered joints alone to give adequate fixing into the assembly. A few isolated components (notably, larger, heavier components) may require additional mechanical support, in the form of straps, nuts, bolts and so on. Where possible, however, such large components should be designed out (that is, care should be taken when designing a circuit not to use such components) of an assembly to keep extra procedures and cost to a minimum. On the other hand, all components may use solder as electrical support to form required electrical connections. No other method has yet been devised to take the place of solder in all assemblies to the same level of performance, cost and ease of operation.', \"2 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nTime  on  its  side   Solder in one form or another has been around for a long time. The Romans   are known to have used solder to form joints in their plumbing systems and,   indeed, the word plumbing refers to the use of lead (from the Latin plumbum   meaning  lead)  as a jointing  compound.  Nowadays,  of  course,  pure  lead   plumbing  is no  longer considered,  instead  solder m  which  is an  alloy  of   mostly tin and  lead - -   is used. It's interesting to note that certain countries   are already in the process of altering legislation to prevent lead being used   in any plumbing  where drinking water is present.   Solder has been adopted by the electronics  industry as the best method   of making joints within assemblies and, for many years, this jointing process   was undertaken manually--  hand soldering.  Inevitably hand soldering is a   slow,  laborious,  time-consuming  and  hence  expensive  process as  each   component  must  be  soldered  into  position  to  the  printed  circuit  board   individually. Quality and repeatability of joints depend almost totally on the   individual  operator.  This  clearly  makes cost  of  large-scale  electronics   assembly  production  uneconomical  and  unsatisfactory.  Generally,  there-   fore,  hand soldering of electronics assemblies is undertaken only in devel-   opment and prototype stages, although there remains a situation  in which   small-volume  production  of  electronics  assemblies is economical.  Hand   soldering is used regularly in  rework stages of manufacture,  where assem-   blies  need to  be  partially  disassembled  for  repair  and  service  purposes.   Because of this  situation  we  need to  consider  hand  soldering  and  so  it  is   discussed in Chapter 7.   For  the  last  40  years or  so,  various  methods  of  automating  soldering   processes  have  been  developed.  It's easy to  see  how  vitally  important   automated  soldering of assemblies has become,  by  remembering  that the   space programme  of  getting  a  man  on  the  moon  could  not  have  been   achieved without  it.   Paul Bud, to whom this book is dedicated, related an interesting fact about   NASA  printed  circuit  boards  used in  spacecraft.  Had  NASA's  assemblies   been hand soldered, joints would have held more solder with the result that   assemblies would have been 10% heavier. So many assemblies are used in   spacecraft that with  this additional  weight,  the three astronauts  (totalling,   say, 250  kg) could  not have been carried!   Until just recently, however ~  say, the last ten years ~  soldering of really   only  one type  of  electronics  assembly  was  in  the  main  undertaken.  This   assembly  type,  a  typical  joint  of  which  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.1,  is   commonly  called the through-hole printed  circuit  board,  simply because   the components feature leads which are inserted through holes in the printed   circuit  board.  Copper  track  interconnections  exist  between  holes  which  \", \"TIME ON ITS SIDE 3\\n\\nmake up the circuit of an assembly and component leads are soldered to the   copper,  so that  mechanical  and  electrical  support  is  provided  with  each   solder joint.  Note that,  in this ideal joint,  solder has been drawn  inside the   hole during the soldering operation mthis occurs by capillary action. Solder   between  the copper track  and the component  lead  is called  the fillet.   Emergence of a different type of electronics assembly m  surface mounted   assemblies or SMAs ~  however,  is altering the face of soldering processes   used. So much  is surface mount technology (SMT) changing soldering that,   at present, somewhere around 50% of all electronics assemblies use at least   a  few  surface mounted components (SMCs ~  also  sometimes  called   surface mounted devices or SMDs). In 1980 the figure was, to all practical   purposes outside  of Japan, zero. This  change  in  assembly technology  has   only  been  possible  with  developments  bringing  a  parallel  change  in   soldering technology. Changes in component technology, too, are pushing   many  companies  along the  surface  mount  route ~  a growing  number  of   components simply cannot be obtained in through-hole forms and are only   available  as surface mounted  components.   Figure 1.1  Soldered joint formed   between a component lead and   copper track on a plated through-   hole printed circuit board  \\n\\nEmergence of a different type of electronics assembly m surface mounted\\n\\nComponent\\n\\nComponent lead fillet \\\\ Printed circuit board base material track Plated through-hole\\n\\nCopper\\n\\n4 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nFigure  1.2  shows  a typical  surface  mounted  assembly joint,  in  which  a   surface mounted  component  is soldered to a printed  circuit  board.  Differ-   ence  between  this  and  the  through-hole  assembly  joint  of  Figure  1.1  is   immediately  a p p a r e n t -   surface  mounted  assemblies  do  not  use holes to   locate component  leads prior to soldering.  Indeed,  surface mounted  com-   ponents do  not have  leads, a fact which  prompts  another descriptive term   for them  - -   leadless components - -   in  contrast with  components  used  in   through-hole assemblies which are often called leaded components. While   we're  defining  terms,  we  may  as  well  go  on  to  point  out  where  leaded   components  are  inserted into a printed  circuit board,  leadless  components   are  loosely said  to  be  onserted onto  a  board.   From  this  description  it's  easy  to  see  that  surface  mount  technology  is   based  on  a  marriage  of  standard  through-hole  techniques  with  hybrid   assembly  techniques  (hybrid  assemblies  are  those  in  which  film-based   components  are combined with  ieadless discrete components on a ceramic   or similar  substrate).   These  two  main  assembly  types  are  only  categories,  and  within  each   category there are many variations, each with specific solder joint concerns   and requirements.  Relevant variations,  joint types and solder processes are   detailed  in Chapter 2.   Figure 1.2  Soldered joints formed   between component terminals and   copper track on a surface mount   assembly printed circuit board  \", 'PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD 5 Printed circuit board Electronics assemblies are based on use of a printed circuit board of one form or another, to hold components. Construction of these printed circuit boards is critical to soldering processes, in that different printed circuit board types have different thermal characteristics, which can greatly affect how they must be soldered. In principle, a printed circuit board (PCB), sometimes called a printed wiring board (PWB), or simply printed board, comprises: a base, which is a thin board of insulating material supporting all the components which make up a circuit; conducting tracks, usually copper, on one or both sides of the base making up the interconnections between components. Compo- nent connecting leads are electrically connected in some form of permanent or semi-permanent way, usually by soldering, to lands, sometimes called pads — the areas of track specially designated for component connection purposes. If lands have holes drilled or punched through the board to facilitate component mounting, the board is a through-hole printed circuit board. If lands have no holes the board is a surface mounted printed circuit board. To clarify, the term printed is somewhat misleading, as tracks are not printed directly onto the board. It refers instead to just one stage within the whole printed circuit board manufacturing process, where the conducting track layout, sometimes called pattern or image, may be produced using some form of printing technique. Printed circuit boards can be made in one of two main ways. First, in an additive process, the conductive track may be added to the surface of the base material. There’s a number of ways in which this can be done. Second, in a subtractive process, where base material is supplied with its whole surface covered with a conductive layer, track pattern is defined, and excess conductive material is removed, leaving the required track. Sometimes, both processes may be combined to produce printed circuit boards with more than one layer of conductive track. Printed circuit board types There are three main categories of printed circuit boards: @ single-sided — in which copper track is on just one side of the insulating base material. In a through-hole single-sided printed circuit board (Figure 1.3a), components are situated on the non-track side of the circuit board while their leads go through the through-holes to the other side, where they are soldered to lands. In a surface mounted printed circuit board,\\n\\n6 SOLDERING PROCESS Hole through board Component Component lead / -— Base material Ar Solder” UL Land Hole through board Component | : Component leads Base | J be cg Track material N 6 tallized layers i -_ = b j Land Solder [7 Fe y (b) Plated through: ! holes (vias) ii Component on underside Component Through via RN Buried via Track N i. \\\\ \\\\ Metallized layers“ Solder Blind via Land U Metallized layer (c) Figure 1.3 Three main categories of printed circuit board (a) single-sided: track is present on only one side of the base and components are usually mounted on the other.

Metallized holes or vias through the board are used to connect track on each side (c) multi-layered: tracks are layered and laminated together. Components may be on one or both sides. Vias are used to connect berween layers components — and their leads or terminals — are situated on the same side of the board as the copper track @ double-sided — in which copper track is on both sides of the insulating base material. In a through-hole double-sided assembly, components are', '6 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nHole through board Component Component lead / -— Base material Ar Solder” UL Land Hole through board Component | : Component leads Base | J be cg Track material N 6 tallized layers i -_ = b j Land Solder [7 Fe y (b) Plated through: ! holes (vias) ii Component on underside Component Through via RN Buried via Track N i. \\\\ \\\\ Metallized layers“ Solder Blind via Land U Metallized layer (c)\\n\\nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD 7 usually (though not always) situated on just one side, and soldered on the other (Figure 1.3b). Where through-holes are required to interconnect top and bottom copper track layers, they are plated inside hole barrels with copper, and are called plated through vias. Where a component lead also goes through a via it is called a plated through-hole (PTHs). In a surface mounted double-sided assembly, components are on the same side as boards are soldered. Components may be mounted on both sides of the board. Note, however, a circuit track on one side of the board is not connected to track on the other side unless plated through-holes are used @ multi-layered — in which several circuit track layers are incorporated into a single board, laminated together with insulating layers between each copper layer. (Figure 1.3c). Plated through-holes can be used for either component terminal connection, or purely as electrical connections {in which case they are called vias). Vias passing from one outside track to the other are called through vias, while those connecting internal track layers are called blind, or buried vias. As many as 30 orso layers are typically made into a multi-layered printed circuit board of around 2 mm thickness. Maximum known to the authors is a board with 60 layers, although boards like this are unusual and very costly. Printed circuit board base materials There are many materials used to make printed circuit boards. Generally, for common applications, materials are of thermosetting or thermoplastic plastics, reinforced for rigidity. Reinforcement materials include sheet paper, glass fibre cloth, cotton fabric and nylon. Fillers can be added to influence characteristics. Table 1.1 lists common printed circuit board laminates, according to British Standard BS 4584 and IEC 249 classifications. Where applicable, classifications according tothe commonly known ANS! NEMA LI standard — which, incidentally, does not exist anymore — are also listed for information. To aid clarification of letter codes, Table 1.2 lists codes along with descriptions. Physical and electrical properties of printed circuit board are also standardized by BS 4548 and IEC 249. These are listed in Table 1.3. While the most common material in printed circuit board laminate production is currently woven glass fabric reinforced epoxide resin, it is worth noting that a trend towards flexible polyimide forms of printed circuit boards is taking place in many consumer products — purely for cost purposes. This trend is expected to continue.', '8  SOLDERING PROCESS   Table  1.1  Common  printed  circuit  board  laminate  materials,  listed  alpha-   betically  by  BS/IEC  laminate  code  classification.

Solders used for electronics assembly   melt at temperatures around 185~  or so, therefore quite simple equipment   (a soldering  iron,  say) can  be used to create individual  soldered joints.   Joints are formed by metallic  bonds between the metals  in the joint area   (usually the copper track of a circuit  board and component  leads) and the   solder.  Modern  solder  is an  alloy,  usually of tin  and  lead  (although  other   alloys  are occasionally  used, and  selected  impurities  may  be  added to  a   conventional  tin/lead  solder to  create  changes in  properties,  as required),  \\n\\n8 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.', 'G-10, G-11, FR-4,\\n\\nX, XP, XPC, XX,\\n\\nXXP, XXPC, XXX,\\n\\nXXXP, XXXPC,\\n\\nfabric, copper conductor\\n\\nSoldering\\n\\nSOLDERING  9   Table  1.2  Letter codes for printed circuit board types   NEMA LI1   Description   Letter code   BS 4584/IEC249   I   I   II   Cellulose paper   CP   Copper conductor   Cu   EP   Epoxide resin   Flexible   F   Woven glass fabric   GC   Woven glass fabric with reinforce-   GCA   ments of non-woven glass filaments   Polyethylene terephthalate (polyes-   PETP   ter)   Phenolic resin   PF   Polyimide   PI   Silicone resin   Si   Flame retardant   FR   Glass fabric reinforced   G   Punchable, if heated to between 50   P   and 80~   PC   Cold punchable, above 25~   Paper reinforced, poor electrical   X   characteristics   XX   Paper reinforced, fair electrical   characteristics   Paper reinforced, good electrical   XXX   characteristics   which  melts at a lower temperature than either of the metals to be joined   this  means that  joints  can  be  made  to  metals  which  form  the  leads of   otherwise  quite  fragile  components.  Further,  the  reasonably  low  melting   point  means many joints  may  be soldered  at the same time with  little fear   of damaging components.  On the other hand, where many joints are to be   formed simultaneously,  equipment becomes  rather more elaborate,  simply   because  of the problems  associated  with  handling  solder  in  molten  bulk.   Note also that lead in solder may not have a very long life. Legislation may   exist in the long-term,  to prevent the use of lead as a constituent of solder.   The process of soldering only occurs on certain surfaces, usually metallic,   and  does  not  occur  on  insulating  surfaces-  this  means solder  may  be   applied  in excess. Alternatives  to soldering ~  welding,  conductive  adhe-   s i v e s -   require much more complex equipment.

In its simplest form, soldering is uncomplicated. Production of a soldered joint requires only that the parts to be soldered are positioned to remain relatively immobile. The surfaces are then heated to allow coverage with molten solder, and the solder is allowed to cool and solidify. However, controlling this process are five variables: @ flux @ wetting @ heat @ solderable surfaces @ time. Flux In most cases, a substance called flux is used in the process, primarily to clean thesurfaces to be soldered and so aid wetting. However clean they are, all metals (with the exception of the noble metals) oxidize to form an oxide layer on their surfaces. Other tarnish products may occur, too. Presence of any tarnish layer will prevent wetting. Flux reacts with the tarnish layers, leaving a pure base metal surface for the solder to wet. A secondary function of the flux is to reduce the solder’s surface tension, so increasing the solder fluidity and aiding wetting. Another is to protect the metal surface during subsequent heating. Heat Application of heat is a prime requirement of any soldering process: solder has a melting point of, typically, around 185 °C. So, to enable its application, the solder has to be heated to at least this temperature. This can be done, in the three extremes, by: @ heating the joint before solid solder is applied (for example, when hand soldering) @ heating the solder until molten before application to the joint (say, in wave soldering) @ applying solder to the joint, then heating both (say, simple infra-red soldering techniques). While techniques exist formed by just one of the three extremes, many', \"SOLDERING 11\\n\\n12  SOLDERING PROCESS   soldering  processes  are elaborate  mixtures  of two  or  all  three.   Note,  it is not a prerequisite  that the joint be  heated  prior to application   of  solder  although,  for  convenience,  it often  is.   Wetting   Wetting  is  the  process  in  soldering  where  the  solder  comes  into  direct   metallic contact with the metals to be soldered together into a joint, forming   a  specific  alloy  of solder  and  metal  at the junction.  In turn,  this  implies  a   joint's  metallic  surfaces  should  be  so  clean  that  metallic  contact  can  be   made.   Often, the term  intermetailic  is used to describe  the bond  which  occurs   between solder and metal when the solder wets the metal (as in intermetailic   bond).  This  is  incorrect:  it  is,  in  fact,  a  strict  metallurgic  term  referring to   intermetallic  compounds,  compounds  of elements  whose  atoms  have  an   so  high  an  affinity  that  their   extremely  high  affinity  for  each  other  ~   presence denies  bonding of other elements  by other  means.  To appreciate   the difference  between  intermetallic  compounds  and  alloys  it's  important   to  realize  that  intermetallic  compounds  have  fixed  stoichiornetric  ratios.   Alloys, on  the other  hand,  have  ratios of metals  which  can  vary.   Wetting occurs when  solder comes  into intimate contact with the metal   atoms.  If the  metal  surface  is perfectly clean  and  metal  atoms are  present,   then the solder wets the metal,  forming a bond  with the metal atoms at the   interface  (Figure  1.4).  Once  this  interfacing  bond,  an  intermetallic  com-   pound  as  it happens,  has  been  created  it cannot  be  removed.   If, on the other  hand,  the  metal  is unclean  in any way, say,  it is oxidized   (Figure  1.5)  such  that  metal  atoms  are  not  present  on  the  surface,  then   wetting cannot occur ~  in a s imi lar way to which a drop of water on a greasy   surface will  remain  as a  droplet.   Figure 1.4   Intimate contact   between solder and a metal surface   occurs when wetting takes place.   An  intermetallic compound is   formed at the interface between the   two  \", '12 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nSy ebay. ee Dae aa ee Solder / Interfacing alloy Base material\\n\\nFigure 1.5   If a  contaminant such   as oxide  is present on  the metal   surface prior to soldering,  no   intermetallic compound  is formed   so wetting  cannot take place   In context with the wetting of metals, two other terms need to be defined.   The first is non-wetting, where part or all ofthe metal to be soldered is devoid   of solder. Usually this occurs where a contaminant or oxide has been left on   the  metal  surface,  so preventing  the  necessary  alloy  bond  between  metal   and  solder  layer.  The  second  is  dewetting,  where  the  alloy  bond  has   occurred,  but  where  the  solder  withdraws  from  the  metal  and  forms   dispersed,  irregular droplets.  Further solder cannot accumulate  due to the   high  surface  tension  formed.  Where  dewetting  occurs,  it  is  sometimes   difficult  to determine;  a simple visual  check  may  not be sufficient.   Both  problems  are  usually  caused  by  lack  of  cleanliness,  although   dewetting can also occur when  large amounts of intermetallic  compounds   form.   Cleaning   There  are  two  areas in  which  cleaning  may  need  to  take  place  in  the   soldering process.  First, the metallic  surfaces to be soldered together must   be perfectly clean,  in order that solder can wet the metals involved. Second,   residues  left  after  soldering  may  need  to  be  removed.  These are  usually   cleaning.  Both  are discussed  in Chapter  I0.   Another pre-assembly area where cleaning  is important,  often out of the   hands of the assembler,  is cleanliness during board manufacture. Where an   assembler  simply  buys-in  ready-made  boards,  problems  of  cleanliness   during  manufacture  may  be difficult  to  isolate,  and  even  more  difficult  to   eliminate.  Cleanliness  of  ready-made  boards  is of vital  importance  when  \\n\\nSOLDERING 13\\n\\nBase material\\n\\nCleaning', '14 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\ncertain  fluxes  (those with  little  reactional  activity)  are used. Modern  trends   indicate  greater  usage  of  such  fluxes  in  the  future,  so  clean  boards  are   correspondingly  more  important.   Solderable surfaces   Solder will  only  join  certain  surfaces.  Generally,  in  electronics  assembly,   these surfaces are of just one main type of metal\" copper. (Occasionally  iron,   nickel  iron and brass parts are found  in assemblies.) Copper is, of course, an   Photo  1.1  Non-wetting,  showing   where copper surface is not wetted   at all, so surface is visible (Alpha   Metals)   Photo  1.2  Dewetting,  showing   surface which is originally wetted,   followed by withdrawal of solder,   leaving an alloy bond on the   copper surface (Alpha Metals)  \\n\\nSOLDERING  15   extremely good electrical conductor and so is ideal for the purpose.  It does,   however,  oxidize fairly easily in air and  is generally protected  somehow to   prevent  oxidation  (which  may  prevent  soldering  taking  place)  prior  to   soldering.   Ability  of  a  surface  to  be  completely  wet  by  solder  is  scientifically   measured as its solderability and the term is one of the most important in the   subject of soldering.  In other words,  it refers to how well  and  how uniform   the  interfacing  alloy bond  between  solder  and  metal  is made.   It fol lows that solderabil ity is concerned with every\\'aspect of the soldering   process  (ie, fluxing,  wetting,  heating,  cleaning),  and  the  main  aspects  of   board  manufacture,  too  (ie, copper  plating,  tin/lead  plating,  solder  resist   application).  Further,  solderability generally decreases with age, as tarnish-   ing of the  metals  involved  occurs  naturally  in  normal  atmosphere.   One of the major problems of guaranteeing  adequate  solderability  is the   difficulty  in  measuring  exactly what solderability  is.  Not so very long ago,   solder  joint  quality  (and  hence,  solderability  of the  metals  involved)  was   determined  by  an  over-simple  visual  check:  the  joint\\'s  brightness  and   smoothness  was thought an  indicator of joint quality.  Indeed,  it sometimes   still  is.  However,  modern  joints  on  surface  mounted  assemblies,  say,  are   Photo  1.3  A  computer-controlled   solderability  tester (Multicore)  ', \"SOLDERING 15\\n\\n16  SOLDERING PROCESS   rarely  bright  and  certainly  never  smooth,  yet  are  known  to  be  joints  of   perfect quality.   In effect,  solder joint quality can  never be determined  by appearance of   the outside layer of the solder. Actual  quality is determined  solely by what   has happened  at the  interface between the solder and the metal.  As this  is   impossible to view,  visual  inspection  consequently serves little purpose in   assuring  joint  quality.  More  cohesive  tests for  solderability  and  for  joint   quality are discussed  in  Chapter 3.   Once a board or component is known to have an acceptable solderability,   it is usual to coat it with  a substance  known  as a protective  coating,  in an   attempt to maintain  solderability.   Protective coatings come  in many forms,  but their simple task is to cover   the copper with a layer of material which doesn't oxidize so readily, yet still   allows copper to be soldered to. This is only an attempt,  note, as no coating   can  maintain  solderability  indefinitely.  Extent to  which  solderability  de-   creases  under  storage  conditions  depends  primarily  on  the  protective   coating  used, but  also  on  the  storage conditions  and  the  thicknesses  of   coatings, so estimates of solderable iifespans, that is, shelf-life,  can only be   approximate.  Boards  should  be  re-tested for  soiderability  after  storage,   before  use. Protective coatings  are discussed  in Chapter  3.   Soldering processes   A  number  of  methods  exist  by  which  electronics  assembly  soldering   processes may be categorized, the first is whether soldering is performed by   hand  or by machine.   Hand soldering   Hand soldering  is usually performed  alongside hand assembly.  It involves   use of purpose-built tools and specific operations, which  depend primarily   on the components being soldered. As a complete process, hand soldering   is discussed  later  in Chapter  7.   Machine soldering   Machine  soldering  methods  are, very  simply,  methods  to  solder  compo-   nents into or onto a board  en masse. For this reason, they are often called   mass soldering methods.  Primary aim of mass soldering methods is to speed   up the manufacture  of electronics  assemblies.   Another method  by which  soldering processes may be categorized  is by   the  mass soldering  process  used. There  are two  main  categories  of  mass   soldering  processes:  \", \"16 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nSOLDERING PROCESSES 17   Q  those processes which  rely on the insertion or onsertion of components   prior to  application  of solder m  from  here called  component/solder  (CS)   processes  m  sometimes,  graphically,  called  flow  or  wave  soldering   processes   Q  those  processes which  rely  on  the  onsertion  of  components  after the   application  of solder ~  from  here called solder/component  (SC) processes   sometimes  called  reflow  soldering  processes.  The  term  reflow  is,   however, a misnomer as it implies previously molten solder is reheated until   molten  once more.  In many cases a solid form  of solder in a paste mixture   is  used in  SC  soldering  processes which,  correctly  therefore,  cannot  be   referred  to as reflow  processes.   At this point it's worth reinforcing what we've just stated. We're introducing   new  terms  into  an  area already  crowded  with  expressions  describing   various  applications  and  processes in the soldering  of electronics  assem-   blies. All  we're trying to do with  these new terms  is to clarify the complex   area.   Put simply: all types of soldering processes for all types of assemblies can   be  categorized  in  just  two  groups  ~  CS  soldering processes and  SC   soldering processes.   CS soldering processes   CS soldering processes position components onto the printed circuit board   then  apply solder.   $C soldering processes   SC soldering  processes, on  the other  hand,  apply  solder  before  positioning   components  onto  printed  circuit  boards.  \\n\\nSOLDERING PROCESSES 17\\n\\n18 SOLDERING PROCESS Figure 1.6 A simple form of dip soldering — lowering and remov- ing the printed circuit board near- horizontally Component/solder (CS) processes There are three main CS soldering processes: @ dip soldering @ drag soldering @ wave soldering. Dip soldering in dip soldering processes the assembled board is fluxed then lowered near- horizontally, into a bath of molten solder as shown in Figure 1.6. Once the lower edge of the board comes into contact with the solder, the board is dropped to a horizontal position on top of the solder. After a suitable period during which the solder achieves wetting over the whole of the areas to be soldered, one edge of the board is lifted (usually the edge which first came into contact with the solder), then the whole board is lifted clear of the bath. Dip soldering suffers from problems in that flux gases are easily trapped under the board and, as a consequence, contact times must be quite tong {about 10 seconds) to ensure adequate wetting and solder temperature must be quite high. Solder Drag soldering By dragging the assembled and fluxed board over the surface of molten solder (illustrated in Figure 1.7), the problems associated with dip soldering processes can be overcome. Consequent contact times are much shorter (about 5 seconds). Wave soldering Wave soldering processes use a pump to create a wave of solder over which the assembled and fluxed board is passed (illustrated in Figure 1.8). Contact times of only 2 to 4 seconds are usual, and required solder temperature is lowered.\", \"18 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nDip soldering\\n\\nSolder\\n\\nFigure 1.7  Drag soldering,  in   which a printed circuit board is   dragged over the surface of molten   solder   Dip and drag soldering processes are older than wave soldering processes   and,  although  both  are  still  used, neither  normally  forms  the  preferred   method  in  most  applications.  For  mass  CS  soldering,  wave  soldering   techniques  are the  norm  and are discussed  in  depth  in Chapter  7.   Figure 1.8  Conveying  the board   over a wave of solder allows much   shorter contact times and lower   temperatures w  the wave soldering   principle   Solder/component (SC) processes   SC soldering processes are used, primarily,  in  surface mounting  assembly   production,  where  solder and flux  are applied  as a paste followed  by the   placement  of  components  and  the  application  of  heat  (Figure  1.9).  SC   soldering  processes  are  often  termed  reflow  processes, known  as  such   because  the  original  idea  uses a  layer  of  previously  applied  solid  solder   which  is reheated to  cause it to  melt,  that  is, flow,  again.   Under this light, the term reflow as it is often currently used is something   of a misnomer,  as we've  already discussed.  This  is simply  because  solder   and  flux  paste  ~  now  the  normal  method  of  applying  solder  before   components  are  assembled  m  in  no  way  can  be thought  of as solid  and  \\n\\nSOLDER/COMPONENT/(SC) PROCESSES 19\\n\\nBoard direction\\n\\n——————> Board direction ——» ] 4 Solder wave\", \"20 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\npreviously  molten  solder.  Further,  soldering  processes can't  be  classified   simply  by  the  two  different  assembly  types  of  through-hole  and  surface   mount designs, because some surface mount assemblies  use CS processes.   Likewise,  it  is feasible - -   though  not currently  usual  - -   for some through-   hole assemblies  to be soldered  by SC means.

By 1994,  in fact, some intend   to have already implemented this, and will  no longer use CS wave soldering   methods at all.   Mass  SC  soldering  techniques  are  generally  categorized  by  type  and   direction of applied heat. These are all discussed (including through-hole SC   processes) in  Chapter 8.   Cleaning   While  cleanliness of electronics  assemblies  is an asset which  all  manufac-   turers  should  strive for,  never has it been  so important  as in  production  of   modern densely-populated  printed circuit  boards. The smaller the compo-   nents are which  are  located on a printed  circuit  board,  and the closer they   are together, the harder it becomes to ensure they are totally clean after all   manufacturing  processes ~  particularly  soldering.   Environmental  concerns regarding the damage which  certain chemicals   do to the ozone  levels  in earth's atmosphere  has restricted the use of those   chemicals.  In a short time (ie, by the end of the century, say) those chemicals   and  indeed some others which  may have otherwise been considered as   alternatives  ~  will  not  be  available  for  use  at  all  as  cleaning  agents.   Consequently,  manufacturers  need to ensure cleaning agents which  cause   no danger to our environment  are used in  cleaning  processes.   Chapter  10  discusses this  cleaning  dilemma  in  electronics  assembly   manufacture,  and describes all  cleaning  processes.   Quality   Given  that  a  circuit  is  properly  designed,  component  parts are  of  good   quality  and  printed  circuit  boards  are  assembled  correctly,  then  solder   processes  hold  the  fundamental  key  to  an  assembly's  quality.  Modern   machine soldering equipment is capable of tremendous achievement, much   ofwhich  is under automatic control. While things work properly and perfect   zero-defect assembled printed circuit boards are coming off the production   line,  everybody's  happy.   But what happens if things go wrong? How do you tell  if a particular fault   is related specifically to your solder machine or to peripheral equipment and   processes? There are so many variables in production  of electronics assem-   blies  ~  particularly  in  the  soldering  process  part  ~   that  it  is  often  not   possible to  isolate the  problem  and  effect a cure.   Answers are not always easy to come  by and  so for this reason we  have   attempted  to  make  things  just  a  little  less complicated  with  Chapter  11,  \", 'Cleaning\\n\\nQuality\\n\\n22 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\n22 SOLDERING PROCESS which considers the question of solder process quality. In it, some examples are used to illustrate some of the main problems which occur in finished electronics assemblies. We think they form a unique collection of visual aids to assist in the identification of solder process-specific problems. Safety Soldering of electronics assemblies, indeed the whole assembly process, is a potentially dangerous procedure. You have to remember any industrial process can be lethal. Equipment in electronics assembly is often used with solvents which may be poisonous or explosive. Materials used are often flammable. In many assembly processes, particularly soldering itself, heat is a hazard when combined with these solvents and materials. Solder itself is a lead alloy, so can cause lead poisoning. In molten form solder, need we say it, is hot — very hot— usually at temperatures between 200°C and 350°C in, say, operational wave soldering systems! It can severely burn skin, and will burn through non-protective clothing to get to skin. Most equipment is of a mechanical nature, with moving parts: pulleys, sprockets, pumps, chains and so on. Fingers, hair, neckties, bracelets and so on can easily get caught in moving parts. Mechanically, these moving parts are very strong and may not be stopped simply by a trapped person trying to pull out an object caught in the machine. Serious physical injury can result. All equipment is electrically-powered. High voltages are present in various system parts. At best electric shocks make you jump. Often they cause burns and severe bodily harm. At worst they stop the heart and so kill. Safety is of vital concern to all personnel involved in soldering processes. Consequently, in Appendix 3, we consider specific safety aspects: describ- ing hazards and possible effects; suggesting ways to avoid them; and detailing first aid which may be required within the varied aspects of soldering. However, these are only items of immediate interest in soldering processes. It is strongly recommended that relevant and sufficient safety procedures be laid down and closely followed at all stages of electronics assembly. Three highly important points regarding safety throughout manu- facturing are: @ follow suppliers’ manuals and instructions closely @ invest in proper safety training @ keep up-to-date with control of substances hazardous to health regula- tions regarding such aspects as safety, materials use, materials storage.', \"Safety\\n\\n2  Electronics assemblies   It's the purpose of this chapter to itemize what main processes are available   in electronics assemblies, and how soldering systems cope with this wide   variety. To do this, we look at electronics assemblies in two ways. First we   consider  assemblies in terms of solder  joints.  For example,  what types of   joints  are  used in  electronics  assemblies and  what  are  their  strengths,   weaknesses, physical  constraints  and anomalies.   Having done this we, second, consider the main variations of electronics   assembly techniques which soldering systems have to cope with n o w ~   and   must cope with  in the near-future.  This we do by looking at combinations   of assembly techniques and components  used.   Joints   For electronics  assemblies there are two  main  categories of joints:   II  through-hole joints   II  surface mount joints.   Within  each category,  though,  there  are  a  few  variations.  Differences   between them  lie not only in obvious factors such as whether components   have leads or terminations, whether holes exist in the printed circuit board,   and  size  (albeit  important  differences)  but  in  a more  obscure  attribute  of   strength.   Whatever  the  category  of  joint  and  whether  through-hole  or  surface   mount components are jointed, there remain just four simple types of solder   joint of interest in electronics assemblies:   II  butt--  a straightforward wetted mating of two end surfaces of metal by   solder  \\n\\n24 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\n24 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES Figure 2.1 Four simple rypes of solder joint (a) butt, (b) single overlap, (c) double overlap, (d) ring and plug @ single overlap — where two plates of metal overlap, and solder wets the two touching surfaces. Overlap joints of single or double form are also commonly known as lap joints @ double overlap — where the joint comprises three metal plates, one within the space formed between two others @ ring and plug — in which a ring of meta! and a corresponding plug are jointed. These are illustrated in Figure 2.1. Strength Mechanical strength is a most important criterion when designing soldered joints. Obviously the joint should be strong enough to withstand all possible stresses it may experience: usually tensile, shear or a combination of both. On the other hand, there is little need to design a joint simply to be technically strongest. A knowledge of use of an assembly after manufacture is thus necessary at the first development stages, in order that correct joint types may be incorporated, strong enough to make the product retiable yet not so strong as to make it inordinately expensive. Insofar as measuring mechanical strengths of solder joints, the practice is largely a matter of testing these four joint types to destruction and collating results, Naturally, certain assumptions are taken regarding whether joints depend totally on tensile or shear strength or not. TREE BOTS TE\", 'Strength\\n\\nTREE BOTS TE\\n\\nTensile strength   The joint which  relies most on tensile strength for its function  is a butt joint.   It is the simplest joint form  and solder in the joint  is theoretically  stressed at   90 ~ to  its interfaces,  thus  is the best indicator  of maximum  tensile  strength   of a solder joint.   As stress occurs  at 90 ~ to joint  interfaces,  strength  is high;  Thwaites  and   Duckett  [Thwaites,  1976  #1]  report  measured  strengths  of  9.4  kgf  mm -2.   Strength  does  however  vary  considerably  with  solder  thickness  (ie,  joint   gap).  Figure 2.2  shows variation  of tensile strength for solder thickness  in a   standard butt joint.  Interestingly tensile strength of butt joints  is greater than   that of bulk  solder  (3.5  kgf mm-2), also shown  on the graph  for  reference.   Shear strength   Remaining  three  joint  types  are  felt,  by  Thwaites  and  Duckett,  to  more   closely  demonstrate  shear strength,  with  ring  and  plug  even  more  so than   the others. A shear strength of 3.7  kgf mm -2 is typical  in a ring and plug joint,   while the overlap joint has a joint strength of 4  kgf mm -2 - -   which  indicates   other strengths exist in an overlap joint.  This is probably due to the fact the   two  metal  plates cannot  lie  in the same plane as they are offset (part of the   joint design), so while shear strength is initially measured as load is applied,   twisting  of the joint  adds some tensile strength  into the result.  Interestingly   double  overlap  joints  are typically  less strong than  single  overlap  joints.

Finally, joint strength also varies with soldering temperature, as shown in   Figure  2.4,  where  overlap,  ring  and  plug,  and  butt  joint  strengths  are   compared.

To put this in perspective, peel strengths of typical printed circuit boards are such that copper track peels from a circuit board if a force of just a small fraction of possible solder joint tensile strength is applied over the few square millimetres of a soldered joint. In effect, materials surrounding a perfectly made joint usually form a limit to a solder joint — not the joint itself. Through-hole joints Through-hole joints rely on the single fact that a wire lead is inserted through a hole in the board, then soldered to bond to a metal track. However, certain factors may differ and affect the exact type of joint, such that four different types of through-hole joint have been specified by previous authors: @ non-plated through-hole, straight lead @ non-plated through-hole, clinched lead @ plated through-hole, straight lead @ plated through-hole, clinched lead. In the following discussion, it is assumed that all joints are perfect, with good, continuous, wetting al! round the area. Non-plated through-hole, straight lead Figure 2.5 shows the joint obtained when a straight component lead is soldered in a non-plated through-hole, such as would be obtained in a single-sided circuit board. This is the easiest through-hole joint to manufacture, as few processes, apart from insertion and soldering, are called for. It is, correspondingly, the weakest through-hole joint, however. Seen in cross-section as in Figure 2.5 it’s clear the joint is similar to the ring and plug joint discussed earlier, which basically depends on shear strength of a solder joint for its strength, so can be expected to have strengths of at least 3 kgf mm”.\\n\\n28 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.5  Non-plated through-   hole, straight lead printed circuit   board joint   Non.plated through.hole, clinched lead   This  joint  configuration  is  shown  in  Figure 2.6,  for  a  lead  clinched  at  a   nominal 45 ~ angle to the horizontal. Now, part of the joint is the same as the   non-plated through-hole,  straight lead soldered  joint,  so will  have around   3  kgf  mm 2  strength from  shear strength  of  solder  joints.  However,  the   remaining  part  of  the  joint  (between  clinched  lead  and  board)  acts as  a   considerable reinforcement, relying on compression of solder anc~/4mechanical   support  of the  component  lead  against  the  printed  circuit  board,  greatly   increasing overall joint strength.   Plated through.hole, straight lead   This joint  is shown  in  Figure 2.7.  Effects of the metallized  plated through-   hole are to allow solder to be drawn  up into the barrel of the hole, around   the lead. This has the effects of increasing strength and decreasing the joint's   electrical  resistance, compared  with the non-plated through-hole,  straight   lead  joint  of  Figure  2.5.

Plated through-hole, clinched lead   By far the strongest through-hole joint, this is shown in Figure 2.8. It includes   the strength of the reinforcement joint between clinched lead and board and   the shear strength of a ring and plug type of soldered hole barrel, together   with  lower joint electrical  resistance of the soldered barrel.   An  important  consideration  in  all  joints  is  the  hole-to-lead  size ratio   (commonly  known,  among  other  things,  as  the  stick-in-a-bucket  ratio),   which  has a large effect on joint strength and ease of assembly. Generally,   closer the lead diameter is to hole diameter, stronger is the joint, while the   opposite  is true for ease of assembly. Table 2.1  lists typical joint strengths   as percentages of maximum  possible joint strength for clearances between   leads and hole, against ease of insertion, for straight leads. Figure 2.9, on the  \\n\\n30 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.7  Plated through-hole,   straight lead printed circuit board   joint   other  hand,  shows  how  joint  strength can  be  expected  to  decrease for   increasing clearance between lead and hole diameters.

If joint strength at this clearance (about 80% of maximum) is insufficient, it is advisable not to decrease hole diameter (thereby decreasing lead-to-hole clearance and making insertion more difficult), but to clinch the lead instead, prior to soldering.

There  are  three   considerations.  First,  if  leads  are  clinched  too  close  to  horizontal,  plated   through-holes  may be physically damaged (Figure 2.10a). Second, clinched   leads with  angles  less than 45 ~ from  horizontal  require asymmetrical  lands   (Figure 2.10b).

Where   leads  are  clinched  in  closing  directions  (Figure  2.1 l a)  solder  bridges  can   often occur.  It is generally  best to specify that leads are clinched  inwards for   any single component  (Figure 2.1 1 b) or in the same direction  (Figure 2.1 1 c)   to  ensure  possibility  of solder  bridging  between  component  leads  is mini-   mized.

Good soldering (Alpha Metals) damage is far more likely to occur because copper track peels away from the printed circuit board. Plated through-holes and, more particularly, clinching of leads form the best solutions where this is a possibility. Surface mounted components A number of component types has been developed specifically for use in surface mounted assemblies. New types are frequently being developed, too, so any categorization of those available must change just as frequently. Types The main types, some known simply by their abbreviation, include: @ chips — in this context, the term chip does not refer to an integrated circuit, but to a type of passive component (eg, resistor, capacitor, inductor), rectangular prism shape @ MELF — metal electrode face bonded components, cylindrical shape @ MIFI — miniature ferrite inductors, rectangular prism shape @ SO— small outline components, generally integrated circuits of rectan- gular prism shape @ SOD — small outline diodes, cylindrical shape ®@ SOIC — small outline integrated circuits, rectangular prism shape @ SOT — small outline transistors, rectangular prism shape @ QFP — quad flat-pack integrated circuits having four rows of terminals, rectangular prism shape ® TA8 — tape automated bonding, sometimes called mikropacks, film integrated circuits in taped form, without protective packaging\\n\\nTypes\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES Figure 2.12 Outline shapes of some common surface mounted components @ tubular — passive components, cylindrical shape @ VSO — very small outline components. in addition, some integrated circuits are mounted into chip carriers, where the term chip does now refer to an integrated circuit, for assembly purposes. These carriers include: @ {CCC — leadless ceramic chip carriers, square prism shape @ PLCC — plastic leaded chip carriers, square prism shape. General outline shapes of some of these components are shown in Figure 2.12. Dimensions of versions of surface mounted components and chip carriers are found in manufacturers’ literatures.

A  joint  in  such  an   arrangement  is  a  simple  overlap  joint  which,  as  seen  earlier,  can  have  a   shear strength  of much  more than  3 kgf mm -2. The joint  is fairly  rigid, there   being no greatly flexible  parts to the arrangement,  so it is commonly  called   a  rigid  lap  joint.

These  leads ensure  the  overlap  joint  formed   between termination  and copper land is a little more flexible than the rigid   lap joint.  For this reason such a joint  is called a compliant  lap joint,  though   more commonly  is known  as a gull-wing joint.

Due to their shape,  components  with  such joints  are called  J-lead compo-   nents. A J-lead joint  has a tensile strength of at least 5 kgf mm -2. It is, due to   its short nevertheless flexible termination, another compl iant surface mounted   component joint.   Another surface mounted butt joint is shown in Figure 2.16.  It is not made   with  a conventional  surface mounted component,  though,  instead a more-   or-less  standard  dual-in-line  packaged  integrated  circuit  is  adapted  by   cropping  its terminals  so the device  sits on  surface  mount  lands.

J-lead joints are usually classed   as a different joint form.   Table 2.2  gives a comparison of vital statistics of the four typical surface   mounted  component joints,  together with  those of a non-plated through-   hole straight lead joint. While land areas and, hence, strengths of the surface   mounted component joints are considerably less than those of the through-   hole  joint,  they  are  still  more  than  amply  sufficient  to  maintain  them  in   position  on the printed circuit board.

These are on a scale of one to five, with five showing   best characteristics.   Surface mount joint  failure   Obviously, like through-hole component joints, strengths of surface mounted   component joints are not limited by the tensile or shear stress encountered   on the joints from  the components themselves.  Similar to joint  strength  in   through-hole joints which, in reality, is quite large (far larger, in fact, than the   strength of the circuit board materials surrounding the joint), the type of joint   possible when soldering surface mounted components is also considerably   stronger than  everyday forces  likely to occur  directly on the components.   Instead, however, it is the printed circuit board base material which is more   likely to bear the brunt of forces.   The problem arises simply because of the very small  land which a surface   mounted component is soldered to. Copper foil adhesion strength is no more   than 20 kgf cm -1 [Murata, 1988 #2] on typical printed circuit board--  much   less than  the tensile  or  shear stresses joints  themselves  can  withstand.  In   effect, even the slightest shear force on a joint can pull the land off the printed   circuit  board surface.

Mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion Any differences in thermal coefficients of expansion between a component and the printed circuit board base material will mean, on heating prior to soldering, both component and board expand (Figure 2.17a) then, on cooling after soldering, component and circuit board shrink by different amounts. If the amount is great enough, stresses are set up which pull lands underneath the component terminals from the board’s surface (Figure 2.17b). How much this effect limits use of surface mounted components depends initially on the type of component. Components whose terminals form rigid lap joints, for example, suffer most from this effect, as there is no compliance built-in to the arrangement. A general rule-of-thumb is used when soldering rigid lap jointed surface mounted components (generally those commonly called chip components) to epoxy resin-bonded, fibre glass reinforced circuit boards; which allows use of components upto about 6 mm in length. Many surface mounted components are within this size limit so lands remain unaffected by thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch.', \"J-lead cropped lead\\n\\n42 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.17  Showing how a mis-   match of thermal coefficients   between surface mounted   components and printed circuit   board base can cause damage on   cooling after soldering   Many other rigid lap surface mounted components (leadless chip carriers   form the main group),  on the other hand, are larger than 6 mm.  Such rigid   lap jointing  of these components  to epoxy resin-bonded,  glass fibre  rein-   forced circuit board is not, therefore, possible and in the long run an ultimate   solution  can  only  be  in  use of  printed  circuit  board  base materials  with   thermal coefficients of expansion matching those of rigid components (eg,   ceramic,  metal-bonded).   On  the  other  hand, compliant  lap  and  compliant  butt jointed  surface   mounted  components  larger than  6  mm  do  not  suffer from  any thermal   coefficient mismatch  problem.   Small  outline  diodes  (SODs),  small  outline  transistors (SOTs), small   outline  integrated  circuits  (SOICs), very  small  outline  integrated  circuits   (VSOICs), tape automated bonded integrated circuits (TABs), and so on are   all  components  having  compliant  lap  terminations.  Similarly,  compliant   butt jointing  of components  is obtained with  such components  as plastic   leaded chip carriers (PLCCs). As surface mounted components are known   for their advantage of being leadless, this  is something of a backward step,   not to mention a misnomer,  but does form a short-term solution to a tricky   problem.  \\n\\nComponent terminal \\\\ Solder Ves paste Component Component expands setatenate PRE / Copper land Printed circuit boerd expands Printed circuit board base matenal Component contracts Printed circuit board contracts more\\n\\nFigure 2.17 Showing how a mis-\\n\\nASSEMBLY VARIATIONS 43 Study of the soldered joint, in the context of through-hole and surface mounted components, in this manner is forcing a re-appraisal of the use of solder in electronics assembly. The comparatively low strength of the surface mounted joint appears to be of only minor concern. In effect, compliant lap and butt joints illustrate a successful short-term method of enabling surface mounted components, in quasi-leaded form, to be used with cheaply produced circuit board materials. In the long-term, though, the only solution to enable pure leadless surface mounted assembly must be to develop cheap and easy manufacture of thermally matched circuit boards, or to develop newer bonding processes with significantly improved shear strengths. Assembly variations Having considered all types of solder joints, if we now look at categories of electronics assemblies and consider joint types within them we can form an idea of all possible requirements which are made of soldering processes. This is a useful thing to do, as from it we'll be able to deduce which soldering processes are best suited to particular assembly types and applications. From all assembly methods in general use, we can work out a number of assembly categories. These are listed here, as varieties of component types: @ through-hole components on one side @ surface mounted components on one side @ surface mounted components on both sides @ mixed assembly (ie, through-hole and surface mounted components on one assembly), surface mounted components on one side @ mixed assembly, surface mounted components on both sides. Figure 2.18 illustrates all categories as cross-sections of printed circuit boards. Within each category there are different variants, which obviously affect soldering processes used to a large degree. Consequently we need now to look more closely at each category. Through-hole components on one side Assembly of through-hole printed circuit boards comprises two main processes: @ inserting leaded components @ soldering component leads to the printed circuit board copper track.\", \"ASSEMBLY VARIATIONS 43\\n\\n44  ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES   Figure 2.18  Five variants of electronics assemblies,  shown  in cross-section  (a) through-hole components on one side (b)   surface mounted components on one side (c) surface mounted components on both sides (d) through-hole and surface   mounted components on one side (e) through-hole and surface mounted components on both sides   Figure 2.19  Typical assembly   method for through-hole printed   circuit boards,  using a CS solder-   ing process   Figure 2.20  Possible  basis for assembly of through-hole printed circuit   boards with an SC soldering process  \\n\\n44 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nApplication of solder paste Insertion of leaded components Drying of solder pasie a SC soldering\\n\\nInsertion of leaded components CS soldering\\n\\nA  typical  assembly  method  for  through-hole  printed  circuit  boards  is   detailed  in  Figure  2.19.  Quite  naturally,  basic  through-hole  assembly   soldering  is seen to  be a CS process  ie,  components-before-solder.  Typi-   cally,  mass solder techniques are of wave solder formats,  but dip and drag   systems are possible and a few are used.   On the other hand, SC soldering processes of through-hole assemblies are   possible m  an example  is shown  in  Figure 2.20 --it's  just that they don't   often  exist in  practice.  However,  there  is a situation  (mixed  assemblies   see later) where  SC soldering of  leaded  components  is justified.   Surface mounted components on one side   Both CS and SC soldering processes may be used to solder assemblies ofthis   category.  Differences  are fairly  minimal.   Surface mounted  components  on  one side,  SC soldered   Figure 2.21  Surface  mounted   components  on  one  side,  SC   This is, in terms of the number of steps, the most straightforward  method of   soldered   manufacturing  surface mounted assemblies, shown  in Figure 2.21.  For this   reason,  it  forms  an  entry  point  into  the  manufacture  of  surface  mounted   assemblies  for  many companies.   Solder  paste is  first  applied  to  the  board  in  a  pattern  which  matches   positions of the terminations of components to be placed. Components are   then placed onto the board, the paste is dried and the board  is heated in an   SC soldering process. Typically, drying of solder paste occurs in preheating   stages of soldering processes, so drying and soldering are often thought of   as a single operation.   Application  of solder paste is most often  undertaken  in a screen-printing   process  of  some  kind.  However,  other  methods  are  used, too.  It  is  a   sufficiently important topic to warrant a section of its own and is considered   in depth  at the end of this chapter.   Surface mounted  components  on  one side,  CS soldered   Although  slightly  more  complex  than  the  previous  variation,  use of a CS   soldering process means companies with existing through-hole production   facilities  (which  include a wave soldering  machine)  may be able to adapt   production  lines  to  manufacture  surface  mounted  assemblies.

This stage is followed  by component  placement.   Then,  adhesive  is cured,  the  board  is inverted,  and wave  soldering  of the   assembly  follows.   Surface mounted components, on both sides   Double-sided  surface  mounted  assemblies  usually  require  soldering  by   both  SC  and CS soldering  processes, in  sequence.  Thus,  for  a  company   contemplating  entry  into  surface  mounted  assembly  manufacture,  it  is   comparatively  expensive.   As  shown  in  Figure  2.23,  the  method  of  manufacture  for  this  type  of   assembly is simple addition of the two previous variations. Initially, compo-   nents on the top of the board  must be soldered  first.  Application  of solder   paste is followed  by component placement,  paste drying and SC soldering.   Next, components on the other side of the board are placed and soldered.   So, the board  is inverted, adhesive is applied,  components are placed, and   the adhesive  is cured.  Following  another board  inversion,  wave soldering   is undertaken.   There is an alternative to this method,  using two sequential  SC soldering   processes, illustrated  in Figure 2.24. This is a very cost effective  method of   production  with  high  yields.  Although  at first sight  it  might  seem compo-   nents soldered  in the first soldering operation  will  fall  off the board  as it is   soldered a second time, this is not so because surface tension holds them in   place.   This is a cheaper method than that of Figure 2.23, simply because a single   SC  process  is  used twice,  rather  than  separate CS  and  SC  processes.   Purchase of a CS system is thus avoided. Naturally, this is a popular method.   Mixed assembly, surface mounted components on one side   Here,  there are four  manufacturing  variants.  First is shown  in  Figure 2.25,   where leaded components are inserted  into the board, the board is inverted,   adhesive  is  applied,  surface  mounted  components  are  placed,  and  the   adhesive  is  cured.  Note  that,  as  leaded  components  have  been  inserted   (their  leads now  stick out of the  bottom  of the board)  adhesive  cannot  be   applied  to  the  bottom  of  the  board  by  screen-printing  - -   pin  transfer  or   dispensing  nozzle  methods  must  be  instead  used (see end  of  chapter).   Following  a second  inversion,  the board  is wave soldered.   Second  variant  simply  places  surface  mounted  components  before   Figure 2.23  Surface  mounted   insertion  of  leaded  components  (Figure 2.26).   components  on both sides  \\n\\nApplication of solder paste A = ly ——— a See .

There are problems here,   in that CS soldering  processes do  not always suit complex  surface mount   components.   Third  variant,  however,  completely  separates soldering of each type of   component,  as shown  in  Figure 2.27.  Surface mounted  components  are   initially SC soldered,  then  leaded components  are CS soldered.   Although marginally longer production times are required in this variant,   it does give the advantage that complex surface mounted components,  such   as leaded and  unleaded  chip  carriers, or TAB  integrated  circuits,  may  be   placed  on a mixed  assembly. None of the previous  methods allows this.   Fourth variant is a slightly unusual one, as it entails SC soldering of leaded   components,  using  solder  paste applied  prior  to  placement  of  surface   mounted  components  and  insertion  of  leaded  components.  This  is  not  a   common variant, although it has significant potential; and there is a natural   reason why through-hole SC (THSC) processes may become more popular   m  simply because use of surface mounted components is increasing, while   that of leaded components  is decreasing.   Situations  naturally  exist  where  all  but  a  handful  of  components  are   surface mounted.  Manufacturers  face a choice whether to  use one of the   three  previous  methods  - -   which  all  use  CS soldering  processes to  one   extent or a n o t h e r -   but this may not be acceptable by manufacturers  who   only  have SC  soldering  processes, and  wish  no  further  expenditure  on   equipmentwhich  may be used only a few times. The variant shown in Figure   2.28 has been used often for soldering of connectors and pin grid arrays, but   is now being considered for conventional  leaded  components too.   Through-hole SC soldering processes require use of modified solder paste   application processes (see end of chapter) which allow printing or dispens-   ing  of  solder  paste over  the  through-hole  pad  and  into  the  hole  itself.   Component  leads are then  inserted (usually by  hand,  although  automatic   component insertion  may be viable) carefully,  pushing solder paste further   into  the  hole.  Remnants of  solder  paste may  be  left  on  lead ends of   components.  Prior to or following  insertion of leaded components,  surface   mounted components  are placed.   Assemblies are then soldered  in any SC soldering process. Care must be   taken, though,  to  support assemblies to allow  leaded components  to  seat   freely during the process. Generally a support jig is used to hold assemblies   at their edges.   Two  points  need to  be  considered  when  SC soldering  leaded compo-   nents.  First, leaded  components  must be  able  to  withstand  SC soldering   process temperatures.  In  most CS processes, components  do  not  reach a   temperature  above 120~  but components soldered  by SC processes may   reach temperatures  upto 235~   for some time.

This is due to the limited amount of solder paste applied during printing. When viewed, fillets have a depressed appearance, but this does not significantly affect joint strength. Mixed assembly, surface mounted component on both sides. Where surface mounted components are to be placed on both sides of a mixed assembly, it is common to separate soldering of components on the top and bottom sides of the board. Procedure is illustrated in Figure 2.29. First, after the usual application of solder paste, surface mounted components are placed on the top of the board, the paste is dried, and the components are SC soldered. Next, leaded components are inserted, the board is inverted, adhesive is applied, surface mounted components are placed, and the adhesive is cured. Again, as leaded components have been inserted, adhesive applica- tion cannot be by screen-printing. After final board inversion, wave solder- ing completes the process. This method, like the previous, allows mixed assemblies to contain complex surface mounted components, such as leaded or leadless chip carriers, or TAB integrated circuits. Assembly classification Some of these assembly variations are so common that, by simple conven- tion rather than by standard, a number of classifications are in common use. These are: @ type | — application of solder paste; placement of surface mounted components; drying of solder paste, SC soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.21), illustrated in Figure 2.30 @ type li — insertion of leaded components; inversion of board; applica- tion of adhesive; placement of surface mounted components; curing of adhesive; inversion of board; CS soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.25), illustrated in Figure 2.31 @ type Ill — application of solder paste; placement of surface mounted components; drying of solder paste; SC soldering; insertion of leaded components; inversion of board; application of adhesive; placement of surface mounted components; curing of adhesive; inversion of board; CS soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.29) illustrated in Figure 2.32. While these are valid assembly variations, readers should note they are not the only variations.

Choice of which  of all variations we've  looked   at in this chapter (a total of eleven) should be made on an individual  basis,   and depends on available assembly equipment,  available soldering equip-   ment, available  budget,  particular components  and so on.

Soldering, however, as a general process (more commonly called soft   soldering) may be used to joint  many more things than electronic  compo-   nent  leads and  copper  tracks  of  printed  circuit  boards.  In  effect,  soft   soldering  is the basis of any process  in which  metallic  parts are jointed  by   a molten  alloy with  a melting temperature  less than 450~   Soft soldering is also an extremely old process. As noted in Chapter 1, the   Romans are known  to have used a tin/lead  alloy to joint  lead water pipes.   However,  soft soldering  using tin  and  lead  may  have but a limited  life  left   as an aside it's interesting to note that, at current production  rates of tin,   the world's  resources of the metal  will  give  less than fifty years'  more  use.   There is also a move,  currently, to create legislation against the use of lead   in  solder.   Metallurgical  properties  of tin/lead  alloys   One  of the  most  useful  properties  of  tin/lead  alloys  as soft  solders  is the   associated  range  of  low  melting  temperatures.  Table  3.1  lists melting   temperatures of a selection  of alloys,  with  proportions of the alloys shown   as percentages.  Note  that over a central  range of alloy proportions there is   no particular  melting-point,  merely a range over which the alloy  is neither   molten nor s o l i d -   a pasty or plastic state. However, at one particular alloy   proportion  (62%  tin/38%  lead)  the  alloy  melts  at  a  single  temperature   (183~  m  also the lowest melting temperature of any tin/lead alloy.  Figure   3.1  illustrates  this,  in  what  is  known  as  a  phase diagram, where  liquid,   plastic and solid states of tin/lead alloys are shown, together with the lowest   melting temperature.   A 62% tin/38%  lead alloy composition  is known  as a eutectic composi-   tion,  and  the  183~  melting-point  of this  alloy  is the  eutectic  point.  All   electronics  assembly  processes,  with  few  exceptions,  use  solder  with   constituents around the eutectic proportions,  due simply to the guaranteed   low  melting-point.  \\n\\n52  SOLDER   Table  3.1  Melting  temperatures  of tin/lead  alloys   Alloy as percentages of tin   Melting temperature  (~   and lead   i   I   100 lead   327   300   5 tin/95 lead   267   10 tin/90 lead   281   30 tin/70 lead   182 to 235   40 tin/60 lead   183 to 212   50 tin/50 lead   60 tin/40 lead   183 to  189   62 tin/38 lead   183   70 tin/30 lead   183 to  191   90 tin/10 lead   183 to 213   100 tin   232   Purely  of  interest,  there  appears  to  be  some  confusion  over  the  exact   eutectic proportions and melting-point  of solders.  Most authors refer to the   eutectic  composition  as  63%  tin/37%  lead,  but  more  recent  studies  and   authors  [Leonida,  #3]  [Klein Wassink,  #4]  have noted a eutectic  Composi-   tion  of 61.9% tin/38.1%,  which  sounds altogether more impressive,  in the   Figure 3.1  Phase diagram of tin/   lead alloys  \", '52 SOLDER', \"Alloy as percentages of tin\\n\\nMelting temperature (~\\n\\nand lead\\n\\nI\\n\\nEutectic point (62% tin/38% lead, melting-point 183°C) 1090 3070 50/50 70/30 90/30 100% lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy of tin/lead, expressed in proportions\\n\\nFigure 3.1 Phase diagram of tin/\\n\\nlead alloys\\n\\nMETALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOY  53   Photo 3.1  Three t3'pes of solder:   lead rich (left), eutectic (centre)   and tin rich (right) (Alpha Metals)   absence of first-hand proof (which we are sure most, if not all, other authors   are similarly  without)  we shall  comply  with  the  more  up-to-date findings.   For practical  purposes, at least, there is little difference,  anyway, and many   engineers  within  the  industry  consider  the  63%  tin/37%  lead  alloy  to  be   eutectic.Typicai  tolerances  of +  a few  per cent exist anyway,  in  solder as   delivered  from  suppliers.   Tin is an expensive metal, and so a reduction in the amount used in solder   makes a cheaper solder,  so a 60% tin/40%  lead  solder alloy  is sometimes   used in electronics assembly.  It exhibits a melting temperature range of 6~   rather than a defined  melting-point,  so this means a corresponding slightly   higher process temperature is required; but this generally does not affect the   soldering process significantly. Apart from precision soldering requirements   of, say, multi-layer  printed circuit  boards and surface mounting of compo-   nents,  the cheaper  60% tin/40%  lead alloy  is often  acceptable.   Most  commonly,  however,  eutectic  solder  is  used, simply  because  its   lower soldering temperature gives a lower likei ihood of component damage   in  CS  soldering  process  machines.   as  well  as  lower  dross formation   Maintaining  solder at eutectic  proportions  in, say, a CS soldering  machine   is a task which  must be carefully  attended too.  With  time,  d r o s s -   in the   is  produced  and  so  tin  generally  depletes  from  the   form  of  tin  o x i d e -    solder,  leaving an alloy  rich  in  lead.   Strength and stress resistance   Once made, the soldered joint must be strong and resist reasonable stresses.   Figure 3.2 shows graphs of how tensile strength and shear strength of solder   vary with tin/lead alloy proportions. Although  not quite at the peak of either   graph,  eutectic  tin/lead  solder still  affords  reasonable strength  for joints.  \", \"METALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOY 53\\n\\n54 SOLDER Figure 3.2 Tensile and shear strength variation of solder with tinflead alloy proportion Tensile 10/90 30/70 50/50 70/30 90/10 100% lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy proportions of tin/lead, expressed in percentages Elasticity Due to the fact that tin/lead solders exhibit significant creep, elasticity of solder is difficult to ascertain, but its modulus lies acound 30,000 Nmm?, Creep Creep is a plastic deformation which occurs when a material is subjected to stress for a period. The closer the material is to its melting temperature the more likely it is for creep to occur. It is thus of significance even at ambient temperatures for tin/lead solder, because an ambient temperature of, say 25°C (298 XK) is not too far from the melting-point of 183°C (461 K). Creep follows three distinct stages, illustrated in Figure 3.3: @ primary creep; occurring rapidly when stress is first applied, but decreas- ing with time @ secondary creep; occurring at a constant rate for the greater part of the joint’s lifetime @ tertiary creep; occurring after the joint has been subjected to sufficient secondary creep to cause its final demise. Tertiary creep occurs at an increasing rate, and ends with the joint’s rupture. This property is therefore a disadvantage in any choice of solder for electronic printed circuit board assemblies, but given that other solders will\\n\\n54 SOLDER\\n\\n100%\\n\\nTensile 10/90 30/70 50/50 70/30 90/10 lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy proportions of tin/lead, expressed in percentages\\n\\nFigure 3.3  Showing the three   stages of metallurgical creep   require a significantly higher soldering temperature which  may damage the   components  being soldered,  eutectic tin/lead  solder  is still  preferable-  a   case of advantages outweighing  a disadvantage.   Surface tension   Generally speaking, the lower the surface tension of a fluid, the easier it will   wet a surface to which  it  is applied.  Put the other way  round,  it's a fluid's   surface tension  which  holds  it together  if the surface  isn't easily wettable.   Surface tension is the force which holds insects on the surface of pond water.   It's also the reason why water can only form  into globules on a greasy plate   a detergent wash  reduces  surface  tension  so water  wets  the  plate  and   flows  out  into a thin  layer.   in effect,  surface tension  of any  liquid  acts to  minimize  its surface area.   In absence of other forces surface tension would therefore,  quite naturally,   hold  the  liquid  into  the  three-dimensional  shape  which  has the  smallest   surface  a r e a -   a sphere.  However,  forces  such  as those between  surfaces   or gravity tends to distort the  liquid's  shape somewhat.   Molten lead has a much lower surface tension than molten tin, so it might   be assumed that a higher content of lead than a eutectic solder is appropri-   ate.  However,  lead  itself  exhibits  a  significant  interfaciai  tension  with   copper which  prevents wetting,  so eutectic tin/lead solder remains the best   option.  \", 'METALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOYS 55\\n\\n4 Rupumre Tertiary creep a Elongation _Primary creep Secondary creep / z y — Time\\n\\nFigure 3.3 Showing the three\\n\\n56 SOLDER Resistivity Eutectic tin/lead solder has an electrical resistivity some ten times that of pure copper, but it is still only around 0.17 1Qm\" at ambient temperatures, and given the much larger area of a soldered joint compared with a copper printed circuit conductor the difference is not really a significant problem at all. Thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity of tin/lead solder is about 50 Jm™s\\'K* at ambient temperatures; some one eighth of copper’s. If significant lengths of solder were used on a printed circuit board to make connections this could pose some problems, but the short distances filled by solder within soldered joints generally cause few problems here. The soldered joint Before a solder joint can be made it is imperative solder can wet the basic metals that will form the joint. This is the key to successful soldering. There are two aspects to wetting. First, itis solder’s surface tension which defines how well solder wets a metal. Consequently we should aim to use solder with as low a surface tension as possible. Second, on the other hand, cleanliness of the surface to be soldered is also of paramount importance. If not clean, solder will not wet, however low its surface tension. To illustrate these aspects Figure 3.4 looks at application of solder to a copper surface. There are three important parts to this application: @ a liquid — solder, heated beyond melting point @ a solid — copper, heated to the same temperature @ a gas — the surrounding atmosphere. At one point alone all three parts meet. An angle formed between the liquid and solid, passing through this point, is technically called the dihedral angle (though more usually known as the wetting angle or sometimes the contact angle) and is given the symbol @ (lower case Greek letter theta). This wetting angle is a direct indication of how much the surface of the metal has been wetted by the solder. Figure 3.5 shows four theoretical examples of various degrees of wetting. Figure 3.5a shows a situation where wetting has not occurred at all. Put another way, the surface of the metal is said to be completely non-wetted. Wetting angle 6 here is equal to 180°. Although we\\'ve noted earlier that', '56 SOLDER\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 57\\n\\nFigure 3.4 Application of molten solder to a copper surface THE SOLDERED JOINT 57 Dihedral angle surface tension tends to hold a liquid in a spherical shape if no other forces are apparent, Figure 3.5a illustrates how gravity affects solder globule shape. In Figure 3.5b partial wetting is said to have taken place, where wetting angle is between 0° and 180°. A different wetting condition known as dewetting is shown in Figure 3.5c. Dewetting occurs when solder initially wets a metal surface then withdraws before solidifying as temperature falls below melting point. Really the only difference between dewetting and partial wetting is evidence of wetting has occurred prior to withdrawal. There is, however, no bonding between solder and metal surface. Finally, Figure 3.5d shows the case where total wetting has occurred. Here wetting angle is 0°. Obviously, solder processes should aim for a wetting angle of 0° although, in practice, this ideal is never reached. Instead a good practical wetting angle which gives good wetting is typically taken to be less than about 75° [Manko, #5]. If surface tension of solder is sufficiently low, wetting angle can be reduced to a minimum. Often this is simply a task of maintaining solder quality by eliminating or defining tevels of impurities. Impurities There are three categories of impurities which may occur in the tin/lead solder alloy: @ those impossible to remove from base tin and lead metals in the refinement processes\\n\\nDihedral angle\\n\\nFigure 3.4 Application of molten\\n\\nIn Figure 3.5b partial wetting is said to have taken place, where wetting\\n\\nImpurities', '58 SOLDER\\n\\n58 SOLDER Photo 3.2. Good wetting on copper, showing solder with a small wetting angle and an intermetallic compound layer (Alpha Metals) ® those added by solder manufacturers or users, to improve solder’s performance @ those entering solder during the normal! course of use. Generally speaking, those in the first category aren’t significant and don’t usually affect solder performance. \\\\mpurities specifically added to solder with the aim of improving solder performance include small quantities of antimony and copper, which can reduce solder creep. Table 3.2 lists a selection of tin/lead soft solder alloys. Associated temperatures and approxi- mate proportions of tin, lead and antimony are shown. Antimony also can be used to allow a reduction in the amount of tin tequired in the solder —~ tin is an expensive metal and so the lower the percentage of tin in solder, the cheaper the solder! An alloy of 52% tin/45% lead/3% antimony, for example, exhibits a slightly raised melting tempera- ture andis, in fact, stronger compared with eutectic or near-eutectic tivlead solder. Impurities entering solder during use, however, are generally most difficult to control and can certainly give the greatest problems regarding solder joint quality. This is really of concern only to mass CS soldering processes, where a bulk of solder is maintained at a molten temperature. Here impurities are really contaminants and are not specifically desired for acceptable operation. Contaminants can arise from anything which comes into contact with the solder. Items falling accidentally into the solder — tools, nuts, bolts and so on — are a possible cause, but in most cases contamination comes from the assemblies actually being soldered in the process. This is simply because various metals on each assembly all dissolve to a small extent in the solder. Obviously amounts concerned are minute, but in large volume production systems with consequent large numbers of assemblies each minute amount builds up to eventually affect soldering action to one degree or another. This might be reflected in solder joint quality.\\n\\n@\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT  59   Figure 3.5  Four extremes of   soldered joints (a) non-wetting (b)   partial wetting (c) de-wetting (d)   total wetting   (above) non-wetting (Alpha Metals)   Photo 3.3   Photo 3.4   (right) de-wetting (Alpha Metals)  \\n\\nSolder wr Metal', \"60  SOLDER   Whether contaminants reach a level sufficient to cause process problems   depends on their rate of addition  and the amount of solder removed  in the   soldering process.  It is illustrated in a simple graph of contaminant level and   time  (Figure  3.6).  If  considerable  amounts  of  solder  are  removed  in  the   soldering process, equally considerable amoLmts of solder must be replaced   to maintain  correct solder volume.  Each addition  of fresh solder lowers the   contaminant  level  as a percentage of total  volume  so causing steps in  the   graph.   As contamination  level  increases, tin's ability to dissolve more contami-   nant is reduced.  Eventually, shown by the graph, an equilibrium  is reached   after which further additions of contaminant to the solder creates no further   increase  in  contaminant  level  dissolved.  If this  equilibrium  level  is below   maximum  permitted  levels (ie, levels above which  the soldering process  is   degraded)  no action  need be taken.

Initially taking readings, say, at monthly intervals, may be a good starting point. This allows equilibrium levels to be established and identifies if and when further action has to be taken to remove contaminants. Categories of contaminants There are three main categories of contaminants: @ oxidizing metals — aluminium, cadmium, phosphor, zinc ®@ mixed crystal-forming metals — antimony, bismuth @ intermetallic phasing metals — arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, palladium. Generally these work in similar ways within each category, a factor which allows us to consider their effects on the solder they are added to. Basically, we are interested in how solder wets a copper surface, so the best way of comparing contaminants is to consider how they affect solder’s wetting ability. Wetting ability is just one aspect of solderabitity, which is discussed later, but for now we can see how contaminant categories affect solder’s wetting ability in the wetting force curves of Figure 3.7, where pure solder’s wetting ability is compared against that of contaminated solder of each of the three categories. 3 4 eet td 2 resh solder ———__ Bol AVS E | 4 Cc é| | “a ! { ~ Time Qe\\n\\n3 4 eet td 2 resh solder Bol E | 4 Cc é| | “a !\\n\\n{ Time Qe\\n\\n62 SOLDER Figure 3.7 Wetting force curves of solders with various contami- nants In simple terms, the lower the curve, the lower is that solder’s wetting ability. So, contaminants which oxidize readily decrease solder’s ability to wet. On the other hand, contaminants which are metals which form mixed crystals actually improve solder’s ability to wet slightly. Practically, contaminants have established and typical effects, Some common contaminants and their effects are: @ aluminium — gritty joints; increase in dross* on the solder surface; solder joint appears dull. Antimony eliminates these effects @ antimony — in amounts over about 0.5% can reduce solder’s ability to wet; in smaller amounts improves tow temperature capability of solder joint @ cadmium — reduces solder’s wetting ability substantially; causes solder joints to look very dull, but in minute quantities reduces bridging between components @ copper — gritty looking joints; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ gold — frosty looking joints; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ iron — produces excessive levels of dross which can cause bridging; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ nickel —in small concentrations causes tiny bubbles or blisters on solder joint surface; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ silver — can cause dull joints; in high concentration makes solder tess mobile. Silver is not generally classed as a bad contaminant and is deliberately added to some solder alloys @ zinc — causes dross rate to increase; joints look frosty. *Oross is the oxide formed on the molten solder surface in the solder bath. Rate of dross generation depends on several variables, including; contarmni- nants, temperature and agitation.

Problem  is that copper very easily oxidizes, forming   a thin  layer of  copper  oxide  on  its  surface  very  rapidly  in  air  at ambient   temperatures (at soldering temperatures oxidation  is even more rapid). This   oxide layer effectively forms a barrier preventing solder wetting the surface.   In general,  flux  is used to prepare the copper surface, removing this oxide   layer and maintaining a pure copper surface for solder to wet. It's important   to  note though,  flux  is not a prerequisite for good soldering - -   just a clean   copper surface! Chapter 5 deals with fluxes together with  preparation  and   maintenance  of metal  surfaces.   Intermetailic compound formation   If two strips of copper are soldered together as in Figure 3.8,  magnification   of the  area immediately  surrounding  the joint  by  about 200  times  shows   presence  of  a compound  material  between  the  solder  and  each  layer of   copper's  surface. This compound  material  was  not there  before  soldering   took place and is caused by combination  of tin in the solder with the surface   layer of copper to produce a new compound.  The compound  is a peculiar   type  of  compound  called  an  intermetallic compound. It  has a chemical   formula of one of two types: Cu3Sn or Cu6Sns. Formation of an intermetallic   compound  is always seen when solder wets copper and, in turn, is evidence   that wetting has occurred,  in other words, without intermetallic compound   formation,  soldering  cannot take place.  \\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 63\\n\\n64  SOLDER   Figure 3.8  Magnification  of a   solder joint between two copper   strips shows an intermetallic   compound layer   Intermetallic  compounds  are  molecular  combinations  of  atoms  of  the   metals concerned and so once an intermetallic compound  between tin and   copper exists on the surface of copper it cannot be removed by desoldering   techniques.  This  is  so  because  intermetallic  compounds  are  compounds   with strictly defined stoichiometric  ratios of elements whose atoms have an   extremely  high  affinity  for each other. This affinity  is high  enough to deny   bonding  of  other  elements.  Thus  there  is  a  strict  metallurgic  difference   Photo 3.6  Solder~copper inter-   face,  showing  the copper~tin   intermetallic compound layer as a   line separating  the two (Alpha   Metals)  \", \"64 SOLDER\\n\\nSolder | Copper strip\\n\\nIntermetallic compounc\\n\\nCopper strip Magnification Solder\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 65\\n\\nPhoto 3.7  CS process  solder on a   printed  circuit board track (Alpha   Metals)   between alloys (such as solder - -   tin and  lead) whose element proportions   are variable, and intermetallic  compounds whose element proportions are   fixed  by chemical  formulae.   Factors affecting intermetallic compound formation   Thickness  of the intermetallic  compound  in a soldered joint  is determined   by  temperature  of  the  joint  as  it  is  soldered  and  time  spent  at  that   temperature.  Formation  of  a  tin/copper  intermetallic  compound  occurs   even  at room  temperature,  but the  reaction  is so slow  it  is of no practical   importance to solder joints.   On the other hand, where bare printed circuit boards are coated with very   thin  solder  layers such  as  those  used to  protect  boards  (see later),  it's   important  to  remember  tin  slowly  combines  with  copper  and  so leaves a   lead-rich external  layer. This affects solderability after long storage periods.   lntermetallic  compounds  of tin and copper are harder than either solder   or copper.  They  are also  more  brittle.  If an  intermetallic  compound  layer   becomes  too  thick  a possibility  of  damage  under  thermal  or  mechanical   stress exists, where solder within the joint cracks. This is illustrated in Figure   3.9.   It is not possible to make a good soldered joint unless temperatures  of all   metal surfaces are above solder's melting-point temperature.  Heat to do this   depends on the soldering process used. CS soldering processes typically use   a combination of pre-heating mechanisms together with temperature of the   solder  itself. SC processes use a variety of heating  mechanisms.   In a CS wave soldering process the solder wave is the main supply of heat;   but this only contacts the bottom of the printed circuit board. Consequently,   if a joint's thermal  path from  board  bottom  to board top  is incomplete  it is   not  possible  to  heat  it  up  in  the  small  time  a board  is  in  contact with  the   solder.  \", \"66 SOLDER\\n\\nFigure 3.9   If thick intermetallic   layers exist between  either com-   ponent  lead and solder (left) or   copper track and solder (right),   solder may crack   Figure 3.10a, b and c show stages in the solder process by which a plated   through-hole joint is soldered.  Under ideal conditions-  and with the help   of flux - -   solder first wets the lower surface of the hole (Figure 3.10a), then   begins to wick  up the  hole due to capillary  action  (Figure 3.10b).   As this takes place the solder acts as a liquid piston, forcing the flux  in the   hole  to  rise ahead  of  it.  This  prepares  the track  surface for wetting  by the   following  solder.  Finally,  as the entire hole approaches soldering tempera-   ture, the solder flows out of the top of the hole, wetting the top surface to form   a solder fillet  (Figure 3.10c).   In contrast  Figure 3.1 1 shows a condition  where  cracks  in  the  knees of   hole plating prevent heat flow  through  the joint.  In this case, a correct top   solder fillet  is not formed.   Solderability   One  of  the  most  important  terms  in  theoretical  study  of  soldering  is   solderability--  a measure of a part's ability to be soldered.  In other words,   solderability  gives  us an  idea  how wettable  a part  is, by solder.   Now  solderability  is  a  metallurgical  function  of  a  metal  surface  and,   fortunately,  it is not really necessary these days to study it in any great depth.   Components and printed circuit boards are generally assembled from  parts   of known  and guaranteed solderability so, as far as the soldering process  in  \\n\\nCopper track \\\\ \\\\ A | 4 2 Solder —T\\n\\nSOLDERABILITY  67   Figure 3.10  Stages  in a  CS soldering process,  where  (a) solder first wets the underside  of a plated through-hole (b) solder   wicks upward through  the hole, pushing flux ahead of it (c) solder flows  out of the top of the hole,  to wet the top surface   Figure 3.11  Cracks in the knees   of plated through-holes  may   prevent solder flowing  out of the   top of a hole  \", \"SOLDERABILITY 67\\n\\nComponent lead Copper track SS) || 1] _ Solder wave Solder\\n\\n= = 1} __Printed circuit board L ~ | | | ~~ base material Solder wicks er fi vets | ‘ first wets lower =e upwards, into hole\\n\\nSolder flows out and forms inte top fillet\\n\\nWA Incorrect solder fillet Cracks in knees of hole plating Solder wave\\n\\n68 SOLDER\\n\\n68  SOLDER   Photo  3.8  Upper knee of a plated   through-hole,  with cracks (Alpha   Metals)   Photo  3.9  Upper knee of a plated through-hole, without cracks (Alpha Metals)   electronics  assemblies  is concerned,  solderability  is largely  irrelevant.  For   this  reason interested  readers are referred to  more  specialized texts which   cover the topic to a greater depth  [Klein Wassink,  #4]  [Manko,  #5] than our   requirements,  as well  as relevant national  and  international  standards.   In  soldering  terms,  all  we  need  to  know  here is  how  to  measure   solderability  and what the  results mean.   Measurement  of  solderability  may  be  done  in  quite  a  number  of  ways   which  depend,  basically,  on  what  component  you  are  measuring.  For   individual  component parts such as resistors, leads, semiconductors and so   on,  one  of the  most  common  methods  is the  wetting  balance  method,  in   which a fluxed component is immersed, at a defined rate, in a bath of molten   solder. After a defined dwell time  it is withdrawn  from the bath at the same   rate. Various parts of the wetting balance method are shown  in Figure 3.12,   while the five stages which  make up the procedure are illustrated  in  Figure   3.13. These stages are:  \\n\\nFigure 3.12 Main parts of a wetting balance Figure 3.13 Five stages of the wetting balance method of testing solderability Spring. - = 5 SOLDERABILITY 69 Transducer ‘Analog balance !

Such a force-time diagram is shown in Figure 3.14, marked with various points corresponding to the five stages of the procedure. We can identify solder’s wetting ability on a force-time diagram, simply because it corresponds to the rate at which force changes after wetting commences — thatis, during the third stage of the procedure. Figure 3.15 shows possible graphs representing those obtained at several degrees of wetting. Certain factors have to be accurately defined when taking and comparing measurements of solderability, otherwise results won't be accurate, Some of these factors and typical amounts are:\\n\\n70 SOLDER\", 'SOLDERABILITY 71\\n\\nSOLDERABILITY 7% @ type of solder (say, 60% tin/40% lead) @ solder temperature (say, 235°C) @ flux (say, pure resin, R or WW) @ immersion rate (say, 25 mms!) @ immersion depth (say, 5 mm) @ preparation of component used — say, steam aging for a period of four hours).

Printed circuit board solderability of conductive track and lands can’t be measured easily using the wetting balance, so other methods are typically used [Bud, 1980 #6] instead. These include: @ edge dip test — in which a bare printed circuit board is dipped into solder. After cooling and cleaning it is inspected to ensure solder results fall within defined criteria @ wetting time test — [Thwaites, #7] also called the rotary dip test, in which several small specimens of printed circuit board are successively passed through a solder bath, gradually increasing immersion time, until a perfectly wet board results. The minimum time for good wetting is indicative of solderability @ wave solder test — in which a commercial wave soldering machine is used to solder a succession of boards ina similar way to the wetting time test. Note that this can be a misleading test, so must be carefully supervized and used @ meniscometer test — in which the rise of solder meniscus on or around a printed circuit board specimen dipped in solder is measured. From the meniscus rise it is possible to calculate the wetting angle @ meniscus test — in which solder menisci of defined volume are formed on the printed circuit board. Solderability is a function of solder spread, so a simple measurement of spread is representative of it. Solderability of plated through-holes brings other test methods, including: @ timed solder rise test — in which a printed circuit board is immersed horizontally to a set depth. Time for solder to rise through plated through- holes is a direct indication of their solderability @ solder globule test — in which a printed circuit board through-hole is pressed onto a melted globule of solder. Time for solder to wick up the through-hole is a measure of solderability. Protective coatings Although the addition of protective coatings is specifically a manufacturing process, it is covered in this chapter for sake of completeness; in many cases, as we shall see soon, the protective coating is of solder form anyway and often added to printed circuit boards by conventional soldering processes. The generic term protective coating refers to any coating which is applied to the printed circuit, at any stage, with the purpose of protecting the board', '72 SOLDER\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 73\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 73 from any form of contamination (oxide, moisture and, in some cases, solder itself). Consequently, there are three main types of protective coatings: @ pre-assembly coatings —— applied to maintain solderability, therefore assuring good soldering can take place after assembly @ pre-soldering coatings — solder resists also called solder masks or solder stop-offs (or, if you want to be pedantic and grammatically correct; solder stops-off), which selectively protect parts of printed circuit boards from being soldered @ post-assembly coatings — various encapsulation methods, of which conformal coatings are the most common, which protect the assembled and soldered printed circuit board during its working life. Use of the generic term protective coating is often used specifically to imply only pre-assembly coatings. While this, in itself, is not incorrect, it’s important to remember pre-soldering and post-assembly coatings are protective coatings, too. Pre-assembly protective coatings Once component parts (usually bare printed circuit boards} of the electron- ics assembly process are known to have defined solderability, it is common to coat them with a protective substance in an attempt to maintain solderability at this level. This is only an attempt, note, as no coating can maintain solderability indefinitely. In most instances pre-assembly protective coatings are of solder form in thin layers over the copper track. This is perhaps seen as advantageous in that it’s solder which is to be applied at a later time anyway. In the remaining few cases, however, organic compound and precious metal coatings are used and it’s here that we start. Organic compounds Two types of organic compounds are used: @ monomolecular lacquers @ resin-based (see Chapter 5), giving approximate solderable lifespans of about three months (mono- molecular) and six months (resin-based). Resin-based coatings give the advantage of aiding most fluxing processes, although hinder application of low-solids fluxes (see Chapter 5). Lacquers dissolve into flux as it is applied, then are dispersed by the soldering process.', \"Pre-assembly protective coatings\\n\\nOrganic compounds\\n\\n74 SOLDER\\n\\n74 SOLDER Figure 3.16 Roller coating solder on to a printed circuit board Thickness is fairly important: too thin and susceptibility to damage or low shelf-life will result; too thick and coatings may crack or blister with the same result. A disadvantage is the fact they are hygroscopic, so absorbing water, which with time will reach the metal underneath, causing oxidation. Advantage of such coatings is their relative low cost. As long as the circuit board is to be used after only a short storage period, they can prove quite economical. Many consumer application assemblies have been manufac- tured recently using lacquered printed circuit boards, for this reason, pantcularty by Japanese companies. Metallic layers Three forms of metallic layer are used to protectively coat circuit boards: @ precious metal plating (gold, rhodium, platinum, palladium} @ silver @ tin/ead alloy coating. Precious metals are often used to protect edge-connection terminals of a circuit board. Their low oxidation rates and metallic softness help to ensure that push-on contacts maintain an adequate low resistance. Thicknesses of precious metal coatings used to protect terminals varies from about 2 um (over nickel-plated copper) to about 5 um (over bare copper). Occasionally precious metals are used to maintain solderability of complete printed circuit boards and, in this case, thickness should be between about 0.25 um and 0.5 jim. Shelf-life of precious metal coated boards is up to 12 months. A coating of pure tin, or tin/lead alloy (ie, solder itself), is the normal method of protectively coating printed circuit boards to maintain solderability. Three main methods are used to coat circuit board surface: @ ‘oller coating — using a solder-covered roller, partially immersed in a solder bath, shown in Figure 3.16.

(Hot-air knives are also found in some machine soldering processes — see Chapter 7). Using a hot-air knife to level a solder coating is commonly knownas hot- air levelling (HAL), Boards properly coated and levelled in this way should have a coating thickness from 5 um to 15 4m, and will have a shelf-life of at least 12 months.

Technically, the process of fusing is one of heating a previously electro- plated tinAead layer to ensure an interfacing alloy bond, while levelling is\", \"PROTECTIVE COATINGS 75\\n\\nBoard, dipped then removed 2 \\\\4 “Q}'O Hot-air knife\\n\\n76 SOLDER\\n\\nthe  process of  removal  of  much  of a tin/lead  layer to  leave  behind  a thin   coating.  These terms  are  often  used incorrectly,  and  are  even  sometimes   interchanged.   Where surface mounted components with fine pitched  lead spacings are   to be placed onto  printed circuit  boards,  plated  boards have an advantage   over  hot-air  levelled  boards  simply  because  the  surface  is  flatter.  Figure   3.18a shows a cross-section  of a hot-air  levelled  copper track on a printed   circuit  board,  which  is quite  convex.   As the termination  of a fine  pitched  component  is placed  onto the track   it tends to slide off the convex surface,  misplacing the component.  A plated   track,  on  the  other  hand  (Figure  3.18b),  is  relatively  flat,  so a component   termination  is less likely to slide off.   Manufacturing  processes for circuit  boards may  include  tin/lead  plating   of  the  copper  track.  In  such  cases,  it  would  appear  that  no  secondary   protective coating is required.  However, solderability of the original copper   surface, prior to tin/lead electroplating is important here. If the electroplated   layer  is  applied  to  copper  which  is  not  solderable,  on  heating  to  ensure   fusing the electroplated  layer will  become dewetted and maybe even  non-   wetted - -   the original  copper surface must have acceptable solderability to   prevent this.

In such  cases solder  resists,  sometimes  called  solder masks   or  solder  stop-offs,  can  be  used. Fairly  obviously,  a  solder  resist must   provide two functions.  First, it must be heat resistant, to prevent the heat of   the  soldering  process  from  breaking  it  down.  Second,  it  must  be  non-   wettable.   Solder  resists can  be  temporary,  in  that  they  are  removed  after  the   soldering  process, or  permanent.  In  general,  temporary  solder  resists are   used to  protect  particular  areas of a  PCB  during  mass soldering  methods   such as dip, drag, and wave soldering. They are typically used to keep small   areas such as plated through-holes, gold-plated contacts and so on, clear of   solder  for  later  purposes.  After  soldering,  they  are  removed.  Although   usually of a liquid  form,  applied  to the surface  of the  PCB, then  left to dry   before  soldering,  mechanical  resists such  as  plastic  or  wooden  plugs  or   inserts, and even adhesive tape are not unknown. Occasionally, protrusions   from  soldering  machine  conveyor  systems are  used  to  mask areas of   assemblies  from  the  soldering  process. These are only  economical,  how-   ever,  in large-volume production,  and the area to be masked must be allied   to an edge of the assembly for the protrusion  to be able to cover  it and  no   other areas.   Permanent  solder  resists are  often  used to  eliminate  the  risk  of  solder   bridges  between  closely-spaced  adjacent  tracks.  This  means  that  PCB   designers  can  reduce  gap  sizes and  have  extra  freedom  in  track  layouts.   Secondary  advantages  include:  physical  protection  of tracks,  particularly   those of a fine-line nature; reduced drainage of solder from joints which may   otherwise cause the joints  to be poorly soldered;  reduced  consumption  of   solder  overall,  coupled  with  reduced  contamination  of the  solder  in  the   bath; a known  dielectric  present between tracks (although this can change   with  ingression  of water);  improved visual  inspection of solder joints due to   the fact that resist reflects  light  less than joints;  good  appearance.   Permanent solder resists are applied  using conventional  screen-printing   techniques or, where high accuracy is important such as in the production   of  fine-line  boards,  they  are  photo-printed  following  liquid  or  dry-film   application.  Two  main  types of permanent solder resist are used:   Q  epoxy-based   @  acrylate-based.

Assemblies and components may be subjected to either a corrosive environ- ment or a mechanically stressful environment. Effects of one or both of these environments may be reduced to acceptable levels (though never elimi- nated) by encapsulating assemblies. Assembly encapsulation is a generic term referring to techniques using resin-like materials to package the assembly. There are four main methods of encapsulation: @ conformal coating @ embedding @ impregnation @ potting. Conformal coating By far the most common method of encapsulation, conformal coating, sometimes called surface coating or surface sealing, uses thin (between 0.005 mm to 0.075 mm) transparent coats of materials to provide an electrically insulating protective barrier against humidity, dirt, vaporous contaminants, and foreign bodies such as metal filings. Fully assembled printed circuit boards are often conformally coated to help protect them during normal operating conditions, where hostile environments are not envisaged. Typical coating materials include: @ acrylic @ dially! phthalate (DAP) @ epoxy @ oleo resin @ olystyrene @ paraxylylene ®@ polyimide @ polyurethane @ silicone @ silicone rubber. Of these, acrylic, diallyl phthalate, epoxy, polyimide, silicone and urethane are the most common. A summary of the main characteristics of these six conformal coating types are listed in Table 3.3, based on Concoat’s data [Concoat, 1989 #8].\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 79\\n\\nTable  3.3  Summarized  characteristics of the  six main  conformal  coating types   Characteristic   Acrylic  Diallyl phthalate Epoxy  Polyimide Polyurethane Silicone   I l l    li   I I I    I   III   II   3   2   2   2   Abrasion resistance   1   1   2   1   3   Acid resistance   1   1   1   1   1   3   Alkali resistance   2   1   3   3   3   2   3   3   1   Application  ease   41   Cure  time   3   32   4   3   1   Humidity resistance:   2   1   1   short-term   1   1   1   2   1   2   1   3   long-term   1   2   2   2   1   Mechanical  strength   3   2   3   4   4   Pot-life   3   2   1   Removal:   - -    2   burn   1   m   3   - -    1   chemical   m   3   ~   - -    5   1   2   5   1   Solvent resistance   1   2   1   2   5   Temperature resistance   5   3   5   Notes:  characteristics are recorded in descending  scale of  1 to 5, that is,  1 is  good,  5  is poor.   1  reduced to  3 if heat-cured.   reduced to 2 if heat-cured.   2   I   When  selecting a coating,  known  use and environment of the assembly   must  be carefully  considered.  Manufacturers'  precautions  should  also be   followed,  and  safety precautions  regarding  vapours  and  toxic  materials   observed.   Conformal  coatings  also may  be applied  to  individual  components,  or   sub-assemblies,  in the case of, say, hybrid assemblies to be mounted on a   through-hole printed circuit board. In this case, the conformal  coating is to   protect the sub-assembly during  later  processes, such as soldering,  in the   assembly's  production.   Application  of conformai  coatings  is usually by brushing,  dipping,  flow   coating or spraying. Paraxylylene,  is an exception, as it is applied by vapour   phase  deposition  technique  under  vacuum.  Note  that  application  of  a   conformal  coating  by  spraying  may  cause damage to  electrostatically   sensitive  components.  \", \"Acrylic Diallyl phthalate Epoxy Polyimide Polyurethane Silicone\\n\\nI l l\\n\\nI\\n\\n80  SOLDER   It is sometimes thought that conformal  coatings aid mechanical  strength   and thermal  insulation,  providing  protection  against stresses such as vibra-   tion or thermal  shock, but this is not true, and other encapsulation  methods   must be used where such  stresses are envisaged.   Conformal  coatings do, on the other hand, allow a measure of protection   against  damp  environments,  and  where  occasional  condensation  is  met   conformally  coated  assemblies  may  function  satisfactorily.  But  where   constantly damp environments are encountered, conformal coatings are not   suitable.   Embedding   An  embedding process  completely  envelopes  an  assembly or component   within a protective material not less than 6 mm thick, filling free space in the   assembly.  A  mould  or  container  is  required  to  confine  the  encapsulating   material  while  hardening,  after which  the embedded assembly  is released   from  the mould.  The result is a self-contained  assembly module.   Usually,  mould-releasing  agents  are  used to  treat  a  mould  prior  to   embedding  an assembly,  so that once cured,  the embedded  assembly can   be easily released. Exceptions to this are where moulds are made of materials   such  as polythene  or  PTFE; these  are self-releasing.  Mould  release  agents   may  be  non-drying  liquid,  or  dry-film  forms.  Liquid  forms  may  migrate  to   areas which  require  bonding,  so  as  a  rule-of-thumb,  dry-film  forms  are   normally  preferred.   Impregnation   Impregnation methods rely on the injection of a material into all intervening   spaces  or  voids  of  components  to  provide  environmental  protection.   Impregnation  may  be  used  alone,  or  together  with  other  methods  of   encapsulation.   Pott/ng   Potting is an embedding method where the encapsulating material bonds to   the mould  or container,  becoming  integral with  the item.  Release from the   mould  is therefore  not wished  for.  \\n\\n4 Lead-free solder At the time of writing the debate on using lead-free solders is hotting up. At a recent meeting of the Soldering Science and Technology Club (SSTC — Autumn Conference, 22 October 1998), Nick Jolly of the UK's Department of Trade & Industry asked Is Lead-Free Moving from a Long Term to a Medium Term Issue? As part of the publication of the first draft of the report on Waste from Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Article 4 proposes that lead and other hazardous materials be phased out by 1 January 2004. The future timetable of the full draft is: @ 8 September 1998 — discussion of second draft by next meeting of national experts @ European Commission intends to present proposal to European Parlia- ment and Council of Ministers by end of 1998 or early 1999 @ expect directive to be become effective 18 months after adoption. What’s needed in the future? If the expected lead-free directive goes through, several aspects result directly, including: @ the level of manufacturing industry’s capability to handle implications @ the need to design for dis-assembly @ the need for material reclamation @ no lead @ a requirement for drop-in replacements for tin/lead solder @ organizations must prepare @ there needs to be an awareness campaign.\", \"82 LEAD-FREE SOLDER\\n\\nAt  the  same conference,  James H.  Vincent  of  GEC-Marconi  Materials   Technology - -   Caswell,  presented the paper  IDEALS w  Improved Design   life  and Environmental Aware  manufacture of electronics  assemblies by   Lead-free Soldering. The programme looking at lead-free will be completed   early in  1999. The consortium  includes the programme coordinator:  Mar-   coni  Electronic  Systems G M M T -   Caswell,  as  well  as  several  other   companies;  Philips Centre for Manufacturing Technology, Siemens Corpo-   rate Logisticsolders, Multicore Solders, Witmetaal-  AlphaFry Technology,   N M R C -   University College Cork.   The conclusions thus far are that no single drop-in alloy is suitable for all   applications.  Soldering temperatures are likely to be higher with  lead-free   alloys m  it is suggested that wave soldering processes will  increase by 10~   while reflow processes will  increase 20~  This raises many issues concern-   ing the higher temperature for boards,  components,  equipment,  narrower   temperature profile windows,  board and component finishes.   In summary:  lead-free soldering is a practical proposition with direct and   indirect benefits.  It's an opportunity for the industry,  however,  we  have to   remember that:   We are grateful to Tin International, a journal associated with IT[I, formerly   known as the International Tin Research Institute, for permission to publish   the following  feature article written  by  its chief  lead-free  solder  specialist   Kay  Nimmo.  The  authors  feel  this  article  neatly  sums up  the  lead-free   soldering position.  \\n\\n1\\n\\nLEAD-FREE SOLDERING m  NOW A HOT TOPIC!  83   Lead-free  soldering---  now  a hot topic!   There is a world-wide environmental  movement away from the use of lead,   towards substitute  non-toxic  products based on tin.  There are examples of   lead-free shot, ammunition,  wheel weights,  lamps,  casting alloys for toys as   well as examples of lead-free solders being used in the electronics  industry.   Nortel  was  one  of  the  first  companies  to  announce  the  production  of  a   telephone  using  lead-free  solder,  and  this  product  won  the  company  an   environment  award  in  1997 from  The Financial Post.   The Nortel  lead-free   Photo 4.1   telephone   Just one year on  has seen significant change towards  a worldwide  lead-   free electronics  industry.  While  anti-lead  legislation  was first  proposed  in   the  USA  around  10  years  ago  with,  for  example,  the  Lead  Exposure   Reduction  Act  (S.  729),  and  the  Lead Tax  Act  (H.R.  2479,  S.  1347),  the   momentum  for  lead-free  electronics  has gradually  shifted  away  from  the   USA, through  Europe,  to Japan, where  a growing  number  of major  OEMs   have announced significant voluntary  reductions  in  lead  use within  1 or 2   years.   Examples include; Hitachiwhich will  reduce its use of lead solder in 1999   by  half from  1997  levels  and  stop  using  lead  solder  by  2001;  Matsushita   (Panasonic) which  will  stop  using conventional  lead  solder  in  2001;  and   NEC which  will  reduce  lead  consumption  in  solder by 50%  by 2002.   Many  other companies  are  in  the process of preparing for the  lead-free   solder age including;  Toshiba which  is developing a solder for high-density  \", \"The Nortel lead-free\\n\\nPhoto 4.1\\n\\ntelephone\\n\\n84  LEAD-FREE SOLDER   Lead-free solder   Photo 4.2   alloys now come  in all forms   cellular phone PCBs, and Sonywhich has developed its own lead-free alloy   said to  have a reliability five times that of tin-lead.   Finally, even those companies who do not manufacture  but can specify   materials to be included  in products are involved.  NTT (Nippon Telegraph   and Telephone)is gearing  up for  'green'  material  procurement  by 2001,   when the use of lead and cadmium-free  materials safe for the environment   will  be specified.

The  main   driving  force  towards  lead-free  soldering  is therefore  through  end-of-life   electrical  and  electronic  appliance  legislation  proposed  by the  European   Commission  and Japanese government.   Recycling  legislation  was  pioneered  by  the  European  Parliament  and   Council  Directive  on  End-of-Life Vehicles  (ELVs). The draft directive  pro-   poses that producers should control the use of hazardous substances from   the  concept  stage of  new  vehicles,  in  particular,  the  use  of  lead, PVC,   mercury,  cadmium  and  hexavalent  chromium  should  be  phased out  in   vehicles put on the market after 1 January 2002 (lead in batteries is exempt).   Although circuit boards are also exempt from this draft they may be covered   by an additional  proposal  covering a much  wider  product group.

A   series of equipment types are covered  ranging from  household  appliances   (white goods) to control  instruments,  and from  medical  equipment to video   and sound equipment (brown goods), even watches, games, and automatic   dispensers are  included.  The current draft wishes to:   ensure that the use of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and halogen-   ated flame retardants contained in electrical and electronic equipment is phased out   by 1 January 2004.   The  Japanese ministry  of  trade  (MITI)  has  drafted  a  similar  law  that  will   require consumer and business users of electrical  appliances to return end-   of-life  goods to  retailers or  local  authorities for  recycling.  The cost will  be   borne by manufacturers or importers of the product who will  be required to   arrange for dismantling  and  recycling.   It is often argued that if all electronic waste  is recycled any lead content   can be safely treated.  However,  it is an accepted fact that not all waste will   be collected  and,  particularly  with  small  units  such  as mobile  phones,  the   collection  rate will  be low,  even  if the hazardous material  content remains   high.  Collection  of small  electronic  goods and the separation  of  lead from   these  products  before  recycling  treatments  would  be  extremely  costly   compared  with  the  use of  lead-free solders.   Scandinavia  is  particularly  concerned  over  the  effects  of  lead  and  is   intend!ng to reduce  its use of the metal  whether  recycling can be achieved   or not. A meeting of the Nordic Ministers of Environment in 1994 produced   a statement  that:   in the long run the phasing out of lead is necessary to reduce risk from lead exposure   on human health and the environment.   This was signed by Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland and led   to a proposal  by the Danish  Environment Protection Agency to ban import,   sales and production  of lead and  products that contain  lead.   While this is currently in draft form, and not yet approved by the European   Commission,  it could come into force immediately, and could even be back-   dated  to take  effect  from  1 January  1998.  Lead in  both  the  chemical  and   elemental  form  is covered  and the draft  includes two  clauses  affecting the   use of solder; firstly, those used for incandescent lamps, and secondly, those   used in heating, ventilation  and sanitary equipment.  Once accepted by the   EC, it is likely that other  Nordic  countries will  introduce  similar  legislation   that may also extend to other solder products. Already Sweden is aiming that   all use of lead should eventually be phased out even  in  lead-acid  batteries   despite their well  established  recycling  network.  ', '86 LEAD-FREE SOLDER\\n\\nTHE AGE OF LEAD-FREE SOLDERING IS APPROACHING FAST 87   The age of lead-free  soldering is approaching fast   While environmental  reasons forcing a change away from the use oftin-lead   are seen by some as a negative  process, the switch  to lead-free solders can   bring  positive  advantages.  The  use  of  non-toxic  materials  improves  the   public  image  of  product  and  company  and  brings  potential  technical   advantages as well as possible overall cost savings. It can now be shown that   the switch from tin-lead to lead-free alloys is achievable  if enough informa-   tion  on the replacement alloys  is known.  A conclusion  from  a Brite-Euram   funded  pan  European project  on  lead-free  soldering  is  that  there  are  no   technical show-stoppers to the adoption of lead-free processes and, that the   route to environmentally-friendly  manufacture  and  more reliable soldered   products  seems to be open.   As  part  of  this  project  GEC  Marconi/Siemens  joint  venture  GPT  has   reported  the  successful production  trials  of  a  lead-free  solder.  GPT  has   already eliminated  lead from its circuit board finish and is currently securing   supplies  of lead-free components.  Although  the  new alloy  is slightly  more   expensive than tin-lead GPT expects to offset the cost with savings from the   lead-free  circuit  boards  making  the  total  process  change  cost  neutral.   Additionally  the  lead-free  material   is  twice  as  strong  as  tin-lead  and   therefore  has an  advantage  in  harsh conditions  such  as in  cars.   Panasonic has already released a lead-free Mini-Disc  in Japan (produced   at a rate of 40,000  units a month), that is to be available  in  Europe shortly.   A following  Mini-Disc from  Panasonic will  also use lead-free solder.  Other   products  are  also  expected  from  manufacturers  such  as  Hitachi,  with  all   Japanese OEMs selecting different  solders for each  product dependent on   the  properties  required.  So,  while  one  alloy  may  be  chosen  to  increase   reliability over tin-lead in products seeing extreme service conditions, other   alloys may be selected for a process route where lower melting temperature   is of more  importance.   Lead-free  solders  can  be  found  with  a  variety  of  properties.  When   selecting  which  to  use  the  easiest place  to  start  is  to  consider  melting   temperature ranges. Low temperature alloys such as the tin-bismuth  eutec-   tic  (138~  have  been  in  use in specialist applications  for  many years and   higher temperature alloys, such as the tin-silver eutectic (221 ~   have also   been used in high  reliability  products.  New alloys have been developed to   provide  further  lead-free  options;  the  tin-silver-copper  eutectic  (217~   melts  at  a  slightly  lower  temperature  than  tin-silver  and  can  give  better   solderability  in certain  applications,  a tin-bismuth-zinc  alloy (189-199~   is the  closest  in  temperature  to tin-lead  but  difficult  to  use, while  the tin-   copper eutectic  (227~   is a cheaper,  but  higher temperature option.   It is important to select the correct lead-free alloy for the job n  ask advice   from your supplier or ITRI m  and your lead-free soldering will  be a success.

However,  recent  exciting   advances  in  soldering  machines  have  identified  a  particular  ideal  case   (some controlled  atmosphere ~  usually  nitrogen ~  environments)  where   fluxes  may no  longer  be required  under certain  conditions.  Much  work  is   continuing  in soldering techniques  with  nitrogen  atmospheres.   We  have  already  touched  on  the  prospect  in  Chapter  3,  where  we   considered  preparation  of the metal  surface to be soldered  and stated that   the only prerequisite to successful soldering  is a clean metal surface. We'll   expand on that now and stress that clean means truly clean ie, without oxide   or contamination  of any  kind,  with  an external  surface of pure  metal  and   nothing else. Naturally,  as long as the metal  surface can be maintained  to   this  level  of  cleanliness  as solder  is  applied,  solder  wets  it.  Results from   controlled  environment  processes are so encouraging  it seems likely  they   will  play a major r61e in electronics assembly soldering over the remainder   of  the  decade  and  beyond,  probably  becoming  the  norm  in  large  scale   production  of electronics  assemblies within  just a few years.   In most other soldering  processes, of course (with the only other excep-   tion being ultrasonic soldering),  flux is still a fundamental  requirement; and   will  be so for a while.  Consequently,  much of this chapter discusses flux:  its   importance,  its  function,  and  its  variants,  as  a  vital  part  of  soldering   processes. We  do,  however,  include  a resum~ of no-residue or  low-solids   fluxes;  which,  in reality, perform exactly the same r61e as conventional  flux   as a cleaning agent in controlled environments.  No-residue or low-solids   fluxes  will  become  inevitably  more  and  more  important  as  controlled   environment processes become popular. Their popularity will  probably be   forced  on  the  industry,  as  the  current  drive  towards  elimination  of   chiorofluorocarbons  builds  up speed.  \", '90 FLUX\\n\\n90 FLUX Figure 5.1 Three layers of a copper track Need for flux Fluxes are used in the first place to clean the metal surface to be soldered, then cover it to prevent further formation of contaminants, Contaminants are anything which form a barrier between the pure metal and solder. Obviously the contaminant does not have to be an externally applied material. Commonest contaminant is simply the oxide formed by the metal on its own surface — almost al! metals oxidize immediately on exposure to oxygen in the ambient air and this oxide alone is sufficient to prevent solder wetting the metal surface. To illustrate extent of the problems in cleaning metals ready for soldering, Figure 5.1 shows a section of copper track of an assembly (obviously, not to scale) which shows three distinct layers of material. Most internal is the metal part to be soldered ie, pure metal copper. Next layer is a reaction layer, of strongly bound and so very adherent materials such as oxide, sulphide and carbonate, as well as residues from previous production steps. Finally, and most externally, an absorption layer exists, in which materials such as water, gases and residues from preceding reactions collect. From outside in, therefore, flux must: @ dissolve materials of the absorption layer @ remove oxides, sulphides and carbonates and any other residues @ dissolve some substrate molecules, to initiate formation of intermetallic compounds when solder is applied. Obviously this is a simplification of the job of flux, but it does highlight the process: by cleaning the metal surface then covering it, fluxes keep the surface at a stage of readiness for the solder to flow and wet the metal. On the other hand, besides this vital cleaning and covering function, fluxes must have several secondary characteristics: Absorption layer Reaction layer Pure copper\\n\\nAbsorption layer Reaction layer Pure copper\\n\\nFigure 5.1\\n\\nThree layers of a\\n\\ncopper track\\n\\nHOW FLUXES WORK 91\\n\\nHOW FLUXES WORK 91 Figure 5.2 Four stages in solder wetting a copper surface {a) solid Solder (b) starting to melt (c) starting to flow (d) wetting the copper @ they must be able to withstand the soldering temperature @ they must break down oxide layers formed on the surface of molten solder — this allows solder to flow and wet @ ideally they should not attack and corrode either the metal of the joint or the surrounding materials @ they and their residues after the soldering process should be easily removable. While ail flux systems perform the prime function, these secondary charac- teristics are variable and fluxes perform with significant differences simply because of minor characteristic variations. How fluxes work Figure 5.2 shows a copper sheet, covered with a layer of flux and placed on a heating plate to raise the temperature of the sheet above solder’s melting- point. A ball of solid solder is placed on the sheet (Figure 5.2a) and the heating plate is turned on. As the temperature of the copper rises above solder’s melting-point the solder begins to melt (Figure 5.2b), starts to flow (Figure 5.2c) then wets the copper sheet (Figure 5.2d). Note the resultant small wetting angle and feathered edge of the solder, which indicate good wetting. A close-up view of this action is shown in Figure 5.3, at the point where solder is melting and flowing (equivalent to the situation in Figure 5.2c). Here you can see the copper sheet, a thin layer of copper oxide, flux, solder and solder oxides. In the illustrated process two things are important. First, as the copper sheet heats, it melts the flux which then becomes chemically active. As it does so it dissolves the oxides from the copper surface and the solder surface and prevents any further oxidization.

As the solder flows it pushes the flux (and its resultant   fluxing action) ahead of it. As the fluxing action moves forward,  so does the   solder to wet  more copper.   Effectiveness  of  a  flux  in  removing  oxide  and  contaminants  from  the   surface  of  metals  is  known  as  its  activity.  Fluxes vary  in  their  chemical   activity.  Type  of  flux  used generally  depends  on  the  oxide  layers  of  the   surfaces to be soldered. If only a thin oxide  layer is present,  a flux with only   a low activity  is required.  On the other hand,  surfaces with  a considerable   oxide  layer require  more  highly  active  fluxes.   Anyone  would  be  forgiven  for  thinking  the  best  solution  to  solder  all   surfaces  is to  use only  highly  active  fluxes.  This  way,  whatever  the  metal   surface and however thick  its oxide  layer, soldering is guaranteed. There is   a price  to  be  paid,  however,  when  highly  active  fluxes  are  used  m   flux   activity  is closely allied  with  the corrosivity  of the residues  remaining after   soldering  has  taken  place.  A  highly  active  flux  often  leaves corrosive   residues  which  may  corrode  the  solder  itself.  Effective  post-soldering   cleaning without  delay,  usually with  water,  is essential.   Categorization  of fluxes   Numbers of different types of flux are hard to evaluate (some 46 different low   solids fluxes alone, from  12 manufacturers worldwide  have been recorded   [Rubin, 1990 #9]), so it's easy to see there must be hundreds if not thousands   of  available  types.  Consequently,  to  say  the  very  least,  it  is  difficult  to   correlate  all  types.  What's  more,  fluxes  have  been  used in  one  form  or   another  for  a  long  t i m e -   since  soldering  first  began.  Quite  naturally,   therefore,  many  different categorization  methods  have been  used through  \", \"92 FLUX\\n\\nFlux Copper ~ oxide a Copper\\n\\nSolder can wet cleaned copper Fluxing action\\n\\nCATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 93\\n\\ntime,  depending on what the latest new flux product offered better than the   rest.   We start by defining some of the many important categorization  methods   currently used. First is simply whether they are based on naturally occurring   or  synthetic  materials.  First flux  ever  used in  electronics  was,  in  fact,  a   natural  material-  gum rosin,  also commonly  called  colophony,  which  is   made from  pine tree sap, a resin. This sap, after distillation,  produces solid   rosin  which  is dissolved  in  an organic  solvent such  as alcohol  to produce   flux.  Most  synthetic  fluxes  are  based  on  organic  acids,  although  other   materials  are used.   Another way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues  remaining from   the flux  after the soldering  process.  Thus,  these are  known  as organically   soluble  fluxes,  or  water  soluble  fluxes.  It's important  to  note  with  this   categorization,  however, that the term soluble refers purely to the residues   left  after  soldering,  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  flux  itself  is   soluble  in  organic  solvents  or  water.  Further,  organically  soluble  flux   residues  can often  be removed just with  water and detergent,  while  many   water soluble fluxes can be removed with  some solvents.  So this categori-   zation of fluxes is not particularly  logical,  although  is still  useful bearing its   limitations  in  mind.   Another  categorization  of  fluxes:  non-activated  fluxes  or  activated   fluxes,  refers to whether  chemicals  have been  added  to  increase  activity.   Generally,  a pure  rosin  flux  is  said  to  be  non-activated,  while  any  other   rosin-based flux  is said to be activated.  With  this method of categorization   it's  particularly  easy to  further  categorize  activated  fluxes  into  grades of   activity,  such as:   L  =   low,  or no flux  or flux  residue activity   M  =  moderate flux  or flux  residue activity   H  =  high flux  or flux  residue activity.   These categories  can  be sub-divided,  say, 0 and  1, to  indicate  absence or   presence of halide  in  a flux.   Yet another categorization  of fluxes groups them  according to composi-   tion.  As  each  compositional  type  of  flux  has  its  own  unique  properties   regarding activity and residue solubility anyway, this method of categoriza-   tion  is perhaps one of the most useful,  particularly as it is commonly  used.   Often abbreviations may be used following this categorization  method; the   abbreviations  deriving  from  various  specifications  and  standards,  and   usually referring to the type of activator added. Table 4.1  lists common flux   abbreviations,  abbreviation  meanings,  subsequent types of flux and activi-   ties  according to this categorization  method.  However,  this  method  gives   little  information  regarding what  activators  or solvents  are  used.  \\n\\nAnother way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues remaining from\", '94 FLUX Table 5.1 Common flux abbreviations, meanings, flux types, and levels of activity Abbreviation Meaning Flux type Level of activity R Rosin Purest grade of rosin, no activator added Very low Ww Water white Purest grade of rosin Very low RMA Mildly activated rosin Rosin, with addition of mild activators Mildly active OA Organic acid Organic acid activator Strongly active RA Activated rosin Rosin, with addition of strong activators Strongly active SA Synthetic activated Rosin, with synthetic activators Strongly active SRA Superactivated rosin _ Rosin, with very strong activators Very strongly active Such a hotch-potch of categorization methods and such a wide variety of fluxes inevitably leads to much confusion and ambiguity when users attempt to choose a flux fora given purpose. Acknowledging this, the International Standards Organization has attempted to clarify the situation, distinguishing fluxes according to four variables: @ flux type — whether resin, organic, or inorganic form @ flux basis — what the flux is based on @ flux activation — what type of activator, if any, is included @ flux form — whether liquid, solid, or paste These are summarized in Figure 5.4 and given a number or letter for each variable. Thus, an organic flux, based on phosphoric acid, in paste form, has a Classification as type 321C. Resin fluxes These are often, historically, based on the use of gum rosin obtained from Pine tree sap although many synthetic materials are now used, too. To clear up a potentially confusing point: it’s sometimes common to hear the terms resin and rosin interchanged. Rosin is, in fact, by dictionary definition the solid residue obtained from the distillation of oil of turpentine from crude turpentine — this, by chance alone, happens to include the residue distilled from pine tree sap and used in solder fluxes; what we, ambiguously, know as rosin. On the other hand, resin is an adhesive, inflammable substance secreted by most plants and exuding naturally from fir and pine — that is, sap. Resin can also be made synthetically. So, rosin is distilled from a resin — but that doesn’t mean resin is rosin, or indeed that all resins are made into the rosin used in soldering flux. On the other hand, a resin flux may be based on synthetic resin or natural rosin.', '94 FLUX', 'Very strongly active\\n\\n@\\n\\n   n  o  i  t  a  z  i  r  o  g  e  t  a  c     x  u  l   f  n  o  i  t  a  z  i  n  a  g  r  O     s  d  r  a  d  n  a  t  S     l  a  n  o  i  t  a  n  r  e  t  n  I     4  .  5     e  r  u  g  i  F \\n\\n   n  o  i  t  a  z  i  r  o  g  e  t  a  c     x  u  l   f  n  o  i  t  a  z  i  n  a  g \\n\\nO     s  d  r  a  d  n  a  t  S     l  a  n  o  i  t  a  n  r \\n\\nn\\n\\nr\\n\\ne\\n\\nt\\n\\nn\\n\\nI\\n\\n4\\n\\n.\\n\\n5\\n\\ne\\n\\nr\\n\\nu\\n\\ng\\n\\ni\\n\\nF\\n\\n96 FLUX Where resin is used as a flux, itis dissolved in some organic solvent. Resin flux residues, also, can be removed by dissolution with organic solvent (a fact which makes rosin-based flux the original organically soluble flux). Indeed, rosin has two excellent properties which makes its use as an electronics solder flux preferable to many others. First, as a liquid at soldering temperature it is active, being a mild organic acid, and so provides good wetting capabilities for solder on lightly tarnished metal such as copper and gold. Second, as a residue in solid form, after the soldering process and consequent evaporation of organic solvent, it is basically non- reactive, so does not corrode the completed joint, and is a good insulator. Rosin has excellent flux properties. When heated on an oxidized copper surface it becomes active and attacks the copper oxide. Its active material is abiatic acid which converts copper oxide to a blue copper abiate. This leaves a bright metallic copper surface. As rosin cools it forms a glossy hard layer which is totally inert and protects the copper surface from further oxidation. In all these respects it is, therefore, a perfect flux; it cleans and covers lightly tarnished metal surfaces satisfactorily and there is no specific need to remove its residues from the printed circuit board, unless later manufac- turing processes such as conformal coating require it. Unfortunately, however, basic rosin flux has quite a low activity so is only useful for removing very thin oxides from metals. Fluxes based on synthetic resin can perform in very similar ways to rosin- based fluxes. They often have significant advantages, too, including greater consistency of quality (rosin is a natural substance and can vary consider- ably in quality), lower fuming, and so on. Where metals are too tarnished for resin-based or rosin-based fluxes, resin fluxes with added activators are often used. Such activators increase the flux’s cleaning activity at the soldering temperature, so improving wetting. Needless to say, such fluxes leave corrosive residues, however. Activators include: @ certain organic halide salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (abbre- viation; DMA HCl), and diethylammonium chloride (DEA HCl) @ organic mono-basic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid @ organic di-basic acids such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, sebacic acid. Activators of the first variety are often called halide activators (as they are based on halides of one of the non-metal halogen elements such as chlorine or bromine) while those of the other two varieties are often called non-', '96 FLUX\\n\\nCATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 97 halide activators. Activating agents are selected according to their activity and corrosion properties, ease of cleaning, as well as their (or their vapours’) effects on humans. Rosin production, as it is a natural substance, depends on adequate harvesting from a currently decreasing source. As such, it has fixed properties and, in future, may not be economic to produce. Synthetic resin substitutes often have superior properties and ultimately may be cheaper. While only limited resin-based fluxes are currently available, more will presumably follow. Organic and inorganic fluxes These fluxes are often of a type known as water soluble fluxes, as their residues after soldering are often soluble in water. They are usually produced to be highly active — taking over where rosin-based and resin- based fluxes cannot cope with high oxide amounts. So, their residues are often highly corrosive and so must be removed after soldering. However, as residues are basically water soluble, this eases cleaning. Formulation is based around use of an activator for surface cleaning of the metal to be soldered, and a solvent to ease application. Often, other substances to aid wetting may also be added. Activators include: @ organic salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (DMA HCl} @ organic acids such as lactic acid @ organic amines such as urea @ inorganic salts such as zinc chloride @ inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid @ inorganic alkalis such as ammonia, while solvents typically include water and alcoho! — of one form or another — and sometimes a mixture of these. Water, however, is not an ideal solvent, as it has a tendency to spatter on rapid application of heat. Halide free fluxes Certain national, international and military standards prohibit use of halides (typically chlorides and bromides) in fluxes. This is because standards authorities often believe halide activators to be more corrosive than other activators. Consequently, a category of flux has arisen known as halide-free fluxes. Typically these use mild activators such as organic acids and amine compounds.', 'CATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 97\\n\\n@\\n\\n98  FLUX   No-clean  fluxes   This  term  relates  to  fluxes  whose  residues  need  not  be  cleaned  from  the   board  after  soldering.  Best and  most  obvious  example  is a pure  rosin  flux   with  no  activators.   No-residue  or low solids fluxes   A  no-residue  flux  is one  which  theoretically  does  not  leave  a  residue.  In   practice,  although  residues of such fluxes  are not visible to the  naked  eye,   some residue--however  little--remains.  No-residue fluxes are one variety   of  no-clean  fluxes  and,  it  is  claimed,  are  excellent  choices  for  many  flux   applications  [Rubin,  1990  #9].   They are formed  from fluxes with  a very low solid  content (as low as 1%,   compared  with  most other flux solid contents of 10 to 40%). This fact gives   rise to  a synonymous  term;  low  solids fluxes.   Preparation  fluids   One  of the most recent advances  in soldering  machine technology  is inert   atmosphere wave  soldering,  in which  assembly  soldering takes  place  in  a   controlled  environment  of  inert  gas m  usually  nitrogen.  Without  oxygen   around the solder wave, further oxides form  neither on the solder nor on the   metallic  surfaces to  be jointed.   The other flux function  of cleaning surfaces in the first place,  on the other   hand,  is  still  required.  While  conventional  fluxes  are  usable  in  an  inert   atmosphere wave soldering machine,  the process lends itself to other forms   of fluxes which  simply preparethe metal surfaces prior to soldering,  leaving   little  or  no  residues  at all.  Such  preparation  fluids  are  available,  typically   based on an acid  in an alcohol  solvent. Most common  to date is a 0.5 to 1%   (by weight)  adipic  acid  mixture  with  anhydrous  2-propanol  (isopropanol).   As such,  of course,  they are  m  c o r r e c t l y -   varieties  of  no residue or  low   solids  fluxes,  although  we  treat  them  here  as  belonging  to  a  separate   category  merely  for  descriptive  purposes.   Choosing a flux   Choice  of flux  in  any application  depends  on  a number  of factors:   It  how solderable the assembly is, in other words,  how clean the assembly   is prior to fluxing  ', '98 FLUX\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 99 Figare 5.5 Principle of brush Sluxing @ whether the assembly must be cleaned after soldering @ what cleaning process is used. Consequently, it’s not hard to appreciate; flux should be chosen to suit cleaning processes, rather than the other way round. Application of fluxes Methods of applying flux are manifold — there are almost as many methods as there are flux types. However, methods are conveniently split into whether assemblies to be fluxed are undergoing CS or SC soldering processes. CS soldering processes imply a liquid flux, while SC soldering processes indicate flux is in paste form (in a mixture with solder particles). We consider only the main fluxing methods in both process variations. CS soldering process flux application As most CS soldering processes are based on wave soldering, it’s here where main CS fluxing methods are considered. Usually one of six main methods is used which, in no particular order, are: @ brush fluxing (shown in Figure 5.5), in which a rotating brush dips into flux and spreads it over the bottom of the assembled printed circuit board passing overhead. Although simple, it is not easy to control amount of flux deposited on the printed circuit board, flux runs down the brush bristles, and brushes can disturb components on the board, Such a basic system has been used, however, in second stages of solder-cut-solder processes where leads have been soldered and cut, but assemblies are still hot — other fluxing systems cannot be used to flux hot assemblies Board direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 99\\n\\nBoard direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\n100 FLUX Photo 5.1 Brush fluxer in operation (Marcont) Figure 5.6 Foam fluxing, in which air is forced through flux to create a head of foam @ foam fluxing (shown in Figure 5.6), where air is forced though an aerator into the flux, generating a foam head of flux over which the assembled printed circuit board is conveyed. Aerators may be of porous stone or plastic tubes, or air nozzles. Itis simple to operate and lower in cost than most other methods. Foam fluxing applies a reasonably thin and even coating of flux and is easily set up to give repeatable results, although no residue or low solids fluxes often only allow acceptable foaming with great difficulty. Porous tubes must be kept clean and not allowed to dry out. Foam heights are usually only around 10 mm or so, $0 there are restrictions on through- hole component lead lengths and where leads have not been cut prior to wave soldering, foam fluxing is usually not possible.

Occasionally, foam fluxers are used with brush fluxers, to create a foam of flux which is then brushed on — this prevents flux running down the bristles of the brush. Hot pallets or printed circuit boards may collapse the foam head, however. Foam fluxing is the most common form, simply because it is the most economical and most easily controlled — foam quality is assured by trying to get it to look like the head of a glass of Guinness! @ spray fluxing. Here, several main variants exist. One uses a finely-holed drum rotating in flux, while air from an air-knife forces flux through the drum’s holes onto the printed circuit board overhead (Figure 5.7). Another uses a compressed air spray nozzle, moved backwards and forwards across the underside of the assembled printed circuit board (Figure 5.8). A third uses a compressed spray principle, comprising a bank of atomizing nozzles,\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 101\\n\\n102 FLUX\\n\\nFigure 5.7  Spray fluxing,  using   an air knife  inside a finely-holed   drum   over  which  the  assembled  printed  circuit  board  passes (Figure  5.9).

Most soldering machines using these fluxing techniques follow the fluxing process with an air knife, to reduce excess levels of flux. This prevents too much flux entering the soldering stage, and so reduces possibility of consequent fire. Fluxer Jevel contro! in fluxers in which flux is recirculated it is usual to provide some form of automatic level maintenance, if only to alleviate the need of the machine operator to top up the flux reservoir. Flux level control is not necessary in any fluxer using a spray system. Often used is a pumped system, where the main body of flux is contained ina large tank. A weir in the fluxer body sets flux level and, as flux is pumped from the tank, it flows into the fluxer, overflows over the weir back to the main tank (Figure 5.12). Overflow Flux reservoir Flux density control As solvents used with fluxes tend to evaporate, some form of maintenance of flux density has to be built into recirculating fluxers open to ambient environments. This is especially necessary with fluxers using low boiling- point solvents such as alcohol. Simplest form of flux density maintenance is a hand-dipped hydrometer. Although basic this is most economical and, if performed frequently enough, is every bit as effective as automatic methods.\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 105\\n\\nOverflow Flux reservoir\\n\\n106 FLUX\\n\\nQuite simple electro-mechanical  systems, using photo-electric detection   of hydrometer  position  have been common  in the past. Figure 5.13  shows   an  example  where  flux  flows  through  a  hydrometer  sensor chamber,   overflowing  at  its  top  to  maintain  a  constant  height  for  the  hydrometer.   When  density  changes,  hydrometer  height  varies.  A  marked  band  on  the   hydrometer neck affects output of a photo-sensitive cell,  indicating whether   the hydrometer  is low or high. This actuates a valve controlling  addition  of   thinners to the flux.   Figure 5.13  Flux density control,   using a simple hydrometer~photo-   electric  cell arrangement to control   addition  of thinners   More  common  now  are  density float-type  sensor  syster~s which  detect   level and density of flux, controlling addition of both flux and thinners to the   reservoir.   An exception to the requirement of flux density control  is in sealed fluxer   units.  Here,  as the whole  system is enclosed,  solvent  evaporation  is  not a   problem  so no density control  (or  level  control,  for that  matter)  is needed.   Flux (or preparation fluid)  is not wasted, so consumption  is greatly reduced.   Flux contamination   As  flux  washes  printed  circuit  boards,  it  removes  some  contamination:   grease from,  say, fingerprints;  chemicals  from  earlier  assembly  processes;   dust, and so on. In all but total Iossfluxing systems (where over-applied flux  \\n\\nThinner reservoir 4 /————} n || | | | | lly \\\\ Photo-electric ja cell Pump ¥| = =| NS Sse “8 / TIT? ie, pene Actuator valve Flux reservoir', 'sc SOLDERING PROCESS FLUX  107   is not recirculated)  such as spray fluxers, this contamination  level builds up   and  may  affect soldering  performance.  In  addition,  flux  does oxidize  at a   slow  rate, so becomes  self-contaminated.   Consequently flux  in  recirculating  systems must be dumped  at intervals   and  all  associated  equipment  must  be thoroughly  cleaned.  Intervals  vary   from  system to  system depending  on  use, assembly  throughput  and  extra   contamination  entering  flux  (from  masks, components,  tape  and  so  on).   Often the only way to specify the interval is to monitor and compare boards   at  the  output  of  the  system regularly  - -   when  flux  contamination  is  a   nuisance,  you  have  passed the stage where flux  should  be dumped.   Preheating in CS soldering processes   Although  preheating  is often classed as part of the soldering process itself,   it can be viewed  as just the  last stage of a flux  application  method.  This  is   because preheating serves to dry the flux; evaporating away solvents  in the   flux to  leave a pure flux  form  on the printed  circuit  board.  So, the topic  is   included  here for  completeness,  although  actual  CS  soldering  process   preheating  methods  are discussed more fully  in  Chapter  7.   Preheating,  in fact, has two main effects.  First, it can reduce spattering of   the flux in the solder wave. Second, and most important,  as solvents do not   have to be first evaporated by the heat in the solder wave, and component   parts within the assembly do not have to be heated to soldering temperature   by just  the  solder  wave,  there  is a  resultant  speeding  up  of the  soldering   process itself. So, while preheating is a distinct process in its own  right,  it is   integral  to both  fluxing  and soldering operations.   SC soldering  process flux   Flux in SC soldering processes is applied before components in a paste form,   mixed  with  solder  powder,  and  known  as  solder  paste. Once  applied,   components  are  added  and  the  assembly  made  ready  for  heating.  In  a   preheating stage (see later) the solder paste is heated till  the flux  becomes   active, so cleaning and maintaining the printed circuit board track surface.   Following this,  further  heating turns the solder powder  into  molten  solder   to complete  the soldering  process.   SC  soldering  processes therefore  have  quite  specific  requirements   which must be monitored and maintained  in order that successful soldering   can  be undertaken.  ', \"sc SOLDERING PROCESS FLUX 107\\n\\n108 FLUX SC soldering process flux application Application of solder paste is performed before components are placed onto the board (as opposed to CS soldering processes, where components are inserted before application of flux). This is quite an important distinction, because the presence of solder paste means that components can be later assembled onto the paste (that is, the paste itself can hold the components in place during the rest of the process). There's a number of ways to apply solder paste, including: @ screen-printing, in which a nylon screen or metal mask stencil is held on a frame above the bare printed circuit board, while solder paste is wiped across and so pushed through the stencil with a squeegee @ syringe-type dispensing nozzles, connected with tubing to a pump which forces solder paste from a reservoir out through the nozzles onto the bare printed circuit board @ pintransfer, where pins are first dropped into a reservoir of solder paste, then lowered onto the bare printed circuit board surface. These three methods are covered in detail in Chapter 6. SC soldering process flux classification There are several ways in which SC soldering process flux is classified in solder paste form: @ alloy type @ powder particle size and shape @ metal content @ flux type @ viscosity. These parameters are covered in depth in Chapter 6. Preheating of solder paste in SC soldering processes Unlike CS soldering processes, where preheating may be considered just the final stage in flux application, preheating of SC soldered assemblies is a distinctly separate step. After solder paste is applied in an SC soldering process components must then be placed in a completely separate opera- tion. Only after the assembly is fully loaded with surface mounted compo- nents can it be preheated. Chapter 8 covers SC soldering process preheating in greater detail.\\n\\n108 FLUX\\n\\n6 Solder paste In typical SC soldering processes — and ina very few CS or mixed soldering processes — solder paste is applied to the printed circuit board first. Following this, components are added, then the assembly is preheated and heated to soldering temperature. Obviously, in such processes the key to successful soldering depends (among other things) on the solder paste itself. Solder paste is a mixture of solder particles together with flux. As the printed circuit board is preheated the flux cleans the board tracks, further heating turns the solder particles into molten solder. This chapter first details how the solder paste is applied to a board in the first place. In some instances, adhesive is used to hold components onto a board (say, if the board is to be inverted prior to adding further components). The application methods for adhesive and solder paste are similar, and in many cases are identical. For this reason this chapter refers to adhesive application also. Finally, the chapter looks at solder paste itself, its special requirements and its main variables. Solder paste or adhesive application Solder paste or adhesive is applied to the surface of a printed circuit board by three main methods: @ screen-printing @ dispensing @ pin transfer. Each has its advantages. Screen printing This description of screen printing of solder paste and adhesive owes thanks to Alan Hobby’s article Practical aspects of printing solder paste [Hobby #26]. The authors are grateful for permission to refer closely.\", 'Two  variations  of screen-printing  of solder  paste  or adhesive  exist,  both   relying on the principle of using a stencil positioned above the printed circuit   board,  through  which  solder  paste  or  adhesive  is  forced.  Printed  circuit   boards  are  positioned  and  held  in  place  during  the  process  normally  by  a   vacuum  pump  arrangement.  Process  is  illustrated  generally  in  Figure  6.1.   Both  manual  and  machine  screen-printing  are common  although  manual   methods  tend  to  give  less accurate  results,  for  obvious  reasons.   In the first variation,  a nylon  (or other  similar  material)  screen  is held  on   a frame a small distance above the bare printed circuit board. Holes between   screen  fibres  are  selectively  filled  with  lacquer  emulsion  or  a  similar   substance  prior  to  printing  with  a  negative  of the  image  of  adhesive  to  be   printed. This is generally done in a photographic way, developing and fixing   the  image  in  the  emulsion  which  hardens,  leaving  the  selected  areas  soft.   After washing to  remove  soft emulsion  areas the screen  stencil  is ready for   use. Solder paste  is applied  to the top of the screen  and a squeegee  is used   to push the screen  down  onto the board  at the same time forcing the solder   paste through the holes in the screen onto the board. Figure 6.2 shows close-   ups of the contact points between squeegee and printed circuit board,  as the   squeegee starts  its stroke (Figure 6.2a) and as it nears the stroke end  (Figure   6.2b).  Ideally,  the solder paste or adhesive  rolls  in front of the squeegee  as   it travels across the screen. This shows it is entering the cavities in the screen   to  pass through  it and  give  a complete  print.   Note the screen  is supported  above the printed  circuit  board  such  that a   print gap is well-defined.  This print gap allows the screen to peel away from   the printed circuit board as the squeegee travels over the surface, rather than   snapping away suddenly.  For this  reason the print gap is also known  as the   snap-off  or the  screen  gap.  If the  screen  does snap  away from  the  printed   circuit  board,  print  quality  is degraded,  so  it  is a condition  to  be  avoided.   Although  the  print  gap  depends  largely  on  particular  applications,  an   approximation  to correct setting can  be found  by multiplying  screen  width   by 0.005,  so a 500  mm  by  500  mm  screen  requires  a print  gap of 2.5  mm   or  so.  Ideally  the  gap  is  the  minimum  to  allow  the  screen  to  peel  away   Figure 6.1  The principle of   screen-printing of solder paste or   adhesive  ', \"110 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nSqueegee Solder paste or adhesive n Stencil Frame Printed circuit board\\n\\nSOLDER PASTE OR ADHESIVE APPLICATION  111   Figure 6.2  Close-ups of the   contact point between squeegee and   printed circuit board,  as (a) the   squeegee starts its stroke and (b) it   approaches the stroke end   immediately  behind  the  squeegee.

Shape depends on   the setup used. Generally, the aim  is to maintain the squeegee tip at a print   angle of around 45 ~ to the screen plane,  shown  in Figure 6.3a. This can be   achieved  with  a  trailing  edge  squeegee (like  that  in  Figure  6.3a)  or  a   diamond-section squeegee (shown in Figure 6.3b). Figure 6.4 shows typical   trailing edge and diamond point squeegees. Note that a much greater print   angle gives poorer  paste or adhesive transfer through  the  stencil,  while  a   much shallower angle gives degraded definition. Squeegee pressure must be   sufficient  to  wipe  paste or  adhesive  cleanly  from  the  stencil  surface  as  it   travels across it, though not so great as to decrease print thickness and cause   spreading ofthe image. Low speed typically causes decreased thickness and   spreading of paste or adhesive.  High speed allows  less time for  the screen   to peel away from  the printed circuit board - -   higher speeds can often be   catered for by increasing print gap, however. Actual values of pressure and   speed,  though,  depend  largely  on  the  viscosity  of  the  solder  paste or   adhesive.  Generally,  higher viscosity  requires  higher  pressure and  lower   speed.

Figure 6.5a shows the main culprit, where   a printed circuit board  is positioned  underneath  a screen. As the squeegee   travels across the screen it forces the screen against the edge of the printed   circuit board. With time m  maybe only a few hundred strokes! - -  the screen   becomes  worn  at these points and tears. This  is understandable when  you   consider thread  diameter  of typical  screens used in  screen-printing  proc-   esses is only  around  0.05  mm.  A simple  surround,  into which  the  printed   circuit board fits, is sufficient to greatly extend screen life (Figure 6.5b). This   ensures the squeegee does not now press the screen against the edge of the   printed  circuit  board.  Ideally the printed  circuit  board  should  be proud  of   the surround by only 0.1  mm, otherwise print quality and thickness  control   may be degraded  near the edge, so careful engineering may be needed. An   alternative  is to restrict squeegee travel  to within  the printed  circuit  board   dimensions.

The very flexing action  itself causes the   problems,  in  that they  act as a pump  to  push  paste behind  the  squeegee   blade, which can force solder paste under the stencil and to bleed onto other   areas of the board. As the squeegee passes over a hole, the flexing action can   also scoop out solder paste so the final result is a thin pad for the components   to sit on  (Figure  6.6a).   Metal  squeegees - -   known  as stencil  blades to  differentiate  them  from   their flexible  cousins E  can  be  used (Figure  6.6b)  to  correct against  both   these actions.  They  have the added  benefit that  lower downward  pressure   (less than 50%) is required.  Increased rigidity means that smaller blades can   be used too.   Metal mask stencils   Where  extremely  fine  detail  of solder  paste application  is required,  nylon   screen-printing  suffers from  the  drawback  that  fibres  of  the  screen itself   prevent accuracy. The second screen-printing variation  sidesteps the prob-   lem by using a thin  metal-plate  mask stencil,  suspended  in a conventional   nylon  screen mesh surround,  as shown  in  Figure 6.7.  Production  of masks   is more  complicated  than  production  of  nylon  screens, although  they  are   often made by a similar photographic placement of image as a resist onto the   metal plate, followed  by etching the areas not covered by the resist. Another  \\n\\nFigure 6.6  Metal squeegees/   stencil blades   method  uses laser  cutting  of  the  stencil,  in  a  technique  which  allows   considerable  accuracy  and  promises  great  potential  for  the  future.  Mask   stencils  have  further  advantages  of  a  much  longer  life  than  nylon  screen   stencils, and they allow a possibility of different thicknesses of deposits onto   the printed  circuit  board.   Where  screen  stencils  require a print gap,  metal  mask stencils are often   used with no gap. This prevents solder paste or adhesive seeping through the   open  holes  in the  mask  (this  doesn't  happen  with  nylon  screens, because   Figure 6.7  Method  of suspending   a  metal plate  mask stencil  in a   surround  of screen  mesh  \", 'SOLDER PASTE OR ADHESIVE APPLICATION 115\\n\\nUneven paste deposit \\\\ Metal stencil) blade\\n\\nSqueegee Solder paste Sereen mesh Metal mask\\n\\n116 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nPhoto 6.3  Laser cutting metal   stencil (Alpha Metals)   fibres within  the screen prevent it). However, the result  is that the holding   vacuum can suck solder paste or adhesive through any holes in the printed   circuit  board  (Figure  6.8a), causing poorly  defined  prints.  Masks can  also   snap quite suddenly from the printed circuit board, degrading image quality.   As a result, small  print gaps of around  0.002  of the  mask width  are used,   which  allow a leakage path for the vacuum  (Figure 6.8b).

For instance,  elec-   tronic  assemblies  with  both  leaded  and  leadless components  often  need   solder paste or adhesive  to be applied  as two  separate assembly  processes   (refer to  Figures 2.25  and  2.29).  Also,  variants  of  new  through-hole  SC   processes need solder paste to be applied  in globules which screen-printing   cannot fulfil  (refer to  Figure 2.28).  Screen-printing  is a technique  suited to   reasonably large batches, too. Where only a small number of assemblies are   to  be  produced,  costs relating  to  screen manufacture,  use  and  clean-up   time  may  be  excessive.  In  such  circumstances,  other  methods  are  more   appropriate.   Syringe-type dispensing  nozzles (Figure  6.9) form  a common  method  of   applying  solder  paste or adhesive.  These are computer-controlled  and  so   programmable  - -   such  that they  are  relatively  easily  adapted  to  different   assemblies, making small batch production viable. This situation suits itself,   also, to assemblies  designed  with  computer  aid as the dispensing program   can be taken direct from the computer.  Nozzles are connected with  tubing   to a pump which forces solder paste from a reservoir out through the nozzles   onto the board.  Figure 6.10 shows a typical  dispensing nozzle, which  uses   a syringe as its solder paste or adhesive  reservoir.  This  is a rotary positive-   Figure 6.9  Syringe-type  dispens-   ing is a  common  method used to   apply solder paste  or adhesive  (a)   the nozzle  is lowered on  to the   printed circuit board (b)  solder   paste  or adhesive  is forced  out of   the nozzle (c) the nozzle  is lifted   clear of the printed circuit board   and moved to the next application   point  ', \"118 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nSolder paste 4 Pump forces or adhesive solder paste or adhesive through nozzle Nozzle Jowered onto board\\n\\n| “T] _\\n\\nNozzle lifted from board Solder paste or adhesive dot left on board\\n\\ny:\\n\\nPhoto 6.6  Dispensing  solder   paste provides flexibility  on boards   with components  that are already   in place ~  such as  in this BGA   rework example   displacement  pump  design.

Dispensing solder paste or adhesive over a complete printed circuit board   is a serial function,  each dot of solder paste or adhesive  is dispensed  in turn   and so overall  dispensing  times  per board  are long compared  with  screen-   Figure 6.11)  Principle  of a syringe-   type dispensing  nozzle,  using a   rotary positive-displacement pump   (Speedline  CAM/ALOT)  \\n\\nDISPENSING 119\\n\\nAir pipe, with air at Elecizic siotor — ~ constant pressure Electric a | a THF in nee | Metal —+4 bellows Syringe Air feed to air cylinder Air cylindei echanice .= Linkage Meta ical yy Bi ; Feed tube\\n\\n120 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nPhoto  6.7  Bank of adhesive   dispensers (Dynapert)   printing and vary with board complexity.  However, rates of 45,000 dots   per hour are feasible, and some machines may feature multiple dispens-   ing heads which  reduce overall dispensing times per board.  In a typical   pick-and-place assembly line such dispensing machines can easily keep   pace with  component placement.   Although  such machines  are  quite  expensive  in  terms of  financial   outlay,  they are cheap to  run,  and  especially cheap to  adapt from  one   assembly  application  to  another,  simply  by  changing  the  software   program.   Solder addition   Solder addition by dispensing allows larger amounts of solder paste to be   deposited  on  the  board,  it  is typically  used in  automotive  and  mobile   phone applications. The method eliminates rework and avoids the use of   'stepped'  stencils. With  a dual  dispensing  pump  (see Photo  6.8)  both   solder and adhesive may be applied to the board during a single cycle.

The pin matrix takes the same   pattern to which  components  are placed.  As the  matrix  nears the  printed   circuit board surface, surface tension transfers the solder paste or adhesive   onto the printed circuit  board.   The amount of solder paste or adhesive which  is applied to any particular   dispensing  point  on  the  printed  circuit  board  depends  on  a  number  of   factors,  including:   II  pin  size   II  pin  shape   II  depth pin  is dipped  into the reservoir   ti  closeness pin  is positioned above printed circuit board   II  solder paste or adhesive viscosity.   With  careful  design  of  the  pin  matrix,  therefore,  different  amounts  and   shapes of  solder  paste or  adhesive  dots  can  be  applied  with  a single  pin   transfer operation.   Pin transfer,  like screen-printing,  is an application  method suited to high   volume  assembly  production,  because it  is quite  expensive to  produce  a   complicated  pin  matrix.  However  it is, also  like screen-printing,  cheap to   organize and  run once the pin  matrix  has been produced.  \\n\\nUSING SOLDER PASTE 123 Pin matrix lowered “ in matri Solder paste or lowered over Pin matrix board lifted TH ON ORT q i | { hh | # Solder paste or iy 7 u 8 uur v adhesive dots adhesive Pin matrix remain on board Figure 6.12 Pin matrix application of solder paste or adhesive (a) matrix is dipped into reservoir containing solder paste or adhesive (b) matrix is lowered on to the printed circuit board (c) matrix is lified Alternative methods — fine-line technology Where printed circuit boards are to have extremely fine tracks and small component pads, these three methods of solder paste application alone are thought to be limited. Where fine-line technology in which tracks as small as 50 um or less are required, it is often thought supplementary techniques are necessary. Some recent adaptations of pre-soldering coatings using photo-imagable solder resist (see Chapter 3 for a description of solder resists), prior to screening of solder paste or application of molten solder, report resolutions in the order of 15 um tracks with 38 jum spacings. Using solder paste There are several general — though highly important — points to be noted when using solder paste: @ it's best to use pastes which avoid formation of isolated spheres of solder, remaining after SC soldering processes. Such solder balls may form or collect under components, form short circuits, or both @ solder paste of correct thixotropic qualities should be chosen according to application method (see later). Paste should remain on copper track lands and must not slump to other areas @ solder pastes should spread adequately, and exhibit good capillary action @ solder paste should not cause corrosion of printed circuit board and component parts prior to soldering\", 'USING SOLDER PASTE 123\\n\\nPin matrix lowered “ in matri Solder paste or lowered over Pin matrix board lifted TH ON ORT q i | { hh | # Solder paste or iy 7 u 8 uur v adhesive dots adhesive Pin matrix remain on board\\n\\n124 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\n124 SOLDER PASTE @ there must be strict control of solder particle shapes, to minimize solder oxides forming in the paste. Figure 6.13a shows acceptable solder particle shapes (ie, those with as small a surface area as possible), while Figure 6.13b illustrates unacceptable particle shapes (ie, those with relatively large surface areas). Solder paste is strongly hygroscopic, and because of the small solder particles and resultant large surface area, oxidizes very easily. Correct handling is therefore important, to discourage ingress of water and oxygen. Several precautions are recommended {Siemens, 1988 #20], including: @ store solder paste in a clean and dry place @ before opening refrigerated solder paste, keep it for 24 hours at room temperature to avoid water condensation on opening @ use only clean and inert tools @ close the container tightly after required solder paste is removed @ never return paste to its original container once taken out @ do not add thinners to solder paste @ ifthere is to be along delay between printed circuit board application and subsequent soldering, store assemblies at room temperature in a sealed rack to retain tackiness — not ina refrigerator @ follow manufacturers’ instructions. Solder paste parameters In simple terms solder paste is a cream which comprises powdered pre- alloyed solder, homogeneously blended with a suitably activated flux system — the active flux and solder constituents being closely related to those used in conventional soldering. The flux in this solder cream is however incorporated in a chemically stable blend of resins, chemical activators, solvents and viscosity modifiers all of which combine to give the required properties for application and reflow. The specifying parameters for solder creams — and, hence, solder paste — can be broken down into five main categories as follows. Alley type Today, virtually any alloy type can be produced in a solder cream varying from low melting point (around 100°C) alloys containing Bismuth, to high lead-bearing alloys with melting points over 350°C —-a range which equals the range of soft solder alloys in common practical use. For surface mounted component applications in general the eutectic 63/37 alloy melting point of\\n\\n@', '183~   is  most  commonly  used, although  until  fairly  recently  a  large   proportion  of  applications  required  addition  of  a  proportion  of  silver   (typically 2%) to help prevent leaching of silver from the terminations of   surface mounted devices during reflow. Advances such as the inclusion   of  nickel  barriers  in  terminations  and  the  growth  in  solder-coated   components  have, however,  contributed  to  more  widespread  use  of   standard tin  lead alloys with  a consequential  cost saving.  Silver-bearing   alloys are still the norm for the hybrid circuit industry, however, where the   concern  is of course  for the  leaching of silver from  the fired  on  circuit   terminations  rather than the components themselves.   Powder, particle size and shape   The relative shapes of solder powder particles have formed the subject of   much debate within the industry for many years and  it is true to say that   there are certain advantages to be gained from spherical shaped particles   and others from  uniformly  shaped non-spherical  particles.  Figure 6.13   shows some typical solder particle shapes in use. The emphasis here has   to  be  upon  uniformity  as variations  in  powder  shape  and  particle  size   distribution have effects upon viscosity and application characteristics.  In   general terms powders today are produced as near to 100% spherical as   possible  and with  a tight control  on  particle size distribution.   Typical powder sizes in common use are now between 75 microns and   50 microns and for finer printing and high resolution between 50 microns   and 38  microns  in diameter.

In general terms for the surface  mounted  application   this has been optimized at between 85 and 90%. To some extent this is due   to the great difference  in  density between the flux  vehicle  and the solder   powder. A solder cream with lower than 85% metal will contain a very large   proportion by volume of flux and is likely to cause slumping during pre-heat   and reflow.   Flux type   Development  of flux  systems for  surface mounted  applications  has  been   steady and in line with application equipment requirements. In the majority   of applications a mildly active flux is desired; non-corrosive and with limited   halogen  activators.   Use  of  more  highly  active  fluxes  is  often  mistrusted  due  to  a  fear  of   inadequate cleaning processes after soldering leading to long-term reliabil-   ity problems.   Viscosity   Viscosity  requirements  for  solder  creams are  dependent  on  application   techniques only  and  can  be formulated  for  special  applications,  approxi-   mate guide  lines for application  techniques are as follows:   Screen printing through  mesh   600  k cps (centi-poise)   Stencil printing through  m a s k    800-1000  k cps   Dispensing applications   350-600  k cps  ', \"600 k cps (centi-poise)\\n\\n7 CS soldering  processes   All  CS soldering  processes involve  assembly of components to the printed   circuit  board first, followed  by application  of heat and solder. CS soldering   processes can be totally manual, totally automatic, or something in between   the two extremes. Also, assemblies can be soldered component-by-compo-   nent  in  serial  form,  or  altogether  in  a single  parallel  soldering  operation.   Where components are assembled and joints are soldered individually  in a   manual  way,  the  process  is  known  as hand  soldering.  Parallel  soldering   processes, in which all (usually) components are assembled  into the printed   circuit board and the whole assembly's joints are soldered in one operation   are often  known  as mass soldering.   Hand soldering   Hand soldering is a process in which  components are mounted on a circuit   board,  then  individually  soldered,  joint  by  joint,  until  the  assembly  is   completed. Where through-hole assemblies are being soldered (that is, with   components mounted using components leads inserted through holes in the   board),  joints  are of an easily-produced  reasonable size and  are of strong   construction.  Components themselves are large and easily handled,  as are   the tools used. A typical  assembly and soldering process by hand  is shown   in  Figure  7.1,  where  components  are  inserted  after which  the assembly  is   held with  foam  padding and  inverted,  while soldering  is undertaken.  After   soldering (and after rework), it is important that adequate cleaning measures   are undertaken  to remove flux  and other contaminants.   Joint areas, defined primarily by land sizes, have typical values of around   5 mm 2. This ensures that assemblers can easily see the area to be soldered,   and can  manipulate the soldering  iron  and solder with  no difficulty.  Hand   soldering  of through-hole  components  into  circuit  boards  is a well-estab-   lished  and well  defined  process.  \\n\\nFigure 7.1  Typical hand   soldering process  (a) a   leaded component  is inserted   (b) the component  is   clamped in place  (c) the   component's  leads are   soldered (d) excess  leads are   trimmed   Hand  soldering  of  surface  mounted  assemblies,  on  the  other  hand,  is   much  more  d i f f i c u l t -   due  to  the  small  size  of  components,  and  their   corresponding small joint areas. Land areas of much  less than  1 mm 2 mean   that considerable strain is placed on the assembler to solder joints and, even,   to see what  is to be soldered.  Hand  soldering of surface mounted  compo-   nents  is  not,  therefore,  normally  a  process  undertaken  in  any  volume   production  of circuit  boards.   On  the other  hand,  where  surface  mounted  boards are to  be reworked,   say, for repair after manufacture,  hand soldering (and desoldering)  may be   desirable.  So hand tools  and  aids  a r e   available.   Whatever assembly type is to be soldered, it is important to remember that   final  quality  depends  totally  on  the  operator.  Being  a  manual  task, hand   soldering  quality  cannot  be  guaranteed  to  any  high  and  consistent  level,   unless  suitably trained  and  motivated  operators are used.   Soldering irons   Soldering irons for through-hole components are readily available. Tips are   available in a large range of shapes and sizes, some are shown in Figure 7.2.  \", '128 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nof component ms a\\n\\nFoam padding\\n\\nSeams Solder Clipping \\\\ Soldering MAN \\\\ “s ie\\n\\nFigure 7.2  Typical soldering iron   tips for through-hole components   Usually, a medium-sized general-purpose tip is used to solder most types of   through-hole  components,  although  some  specialized  components  may   require  smaller or  larger tips.   Soldering irons specifically for surface mounted component soldering are   becoming  increasingly  more  common.  Unlike  soldering  irons  tips  for   through-hole  components,  tip shape and size for surface mounted compo-   nents are more critical.  Many are available with  tips shaped to fit specific   surface  mounted  components.  Examples of  two  such  tips,  shaped to  fit   common  surface  mounted  components,  are  shown  in  Figure  7.3.  Many   more  are  available.  Where  a  number  of  types  of  components  are  to  be   mounted,  generally,  an  equivalent  number  of  soldering  irons  would  be   used,  eliminating  the  requirement  to  change  the  tip  with  every  new   component  type to be soldered.

When idling, that is, not being used to solder components but still turned on, to the situation where it is being used consistently to solder components, temperature may easily fall from, say, 420°C to around 300°C. So an ‘iron, after idling for a while, may be hot enough to damage temperature-sensitive components. Although less important when soldering through-hole components, this is not an ideal situation, so irons are usually electronically-controlled, to specific temperatures within the 240°C to 400°C temperature range, so that damage to temperature-sensitive compo- nents may be eliminated. Soldering iron types There are four main types of soldering irons: @ individual soldering irons — comprising a hand-held iron together with lead and mains plug @ soldering stations —- comprising a hand-held iron, connected by lead to a control box of some form. Control boxes usually provide controls for temperature of soldering iron tip, and may contain a digital read-out of selected temperature @ cordless soldering irons — comprising a hand-held battery-powered iron (ie, with no connecting lead) and recharging station @ gas soldering irons — running ona small, rechargeable, internal cylinder of gas lighter fuel. Work stations In a production environment, hand soldering is undertaken at a workbench area, normally called a work station. Typically these will feature parts such as cupboards, drawers, lights and so on, together with several accessories: @ component carousels — typically, a tiered rotating construction, with trays to hold components @ bench racks — trays to hold components, mounted in rows @ component storage cabinets — with pull-out drawers for components @ component dispensers — as one component is removed, the next is automatically positioned ready for removal; useful when many components of the same specification are to be soldered @ cable dispensers — holders for reels of cable @ material dispensers — various peripheral materials (adhesive, solder paste, silicon grease and so on) are often required in hand printed circuit board assembly and soldering; material dispensers ensure a predefined amount of material is dispensed', '130 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nSoldering iron types\\n\\nHAND SOLDERING 131 @ bench mats — laid on the surface of a workbench to protect printed circuit board assemblies and other equipment from damage by discarded components or rough worktops. Bench mats are generally anti-static, to protect components damageable by static charges @ printed circuit board work frames — frames to hold printed circuit boards during component assembly and subsequent soldering @ printed circuit board racks — racks to hold printed circuit boards in pre- assembled, partially assembled, or assembled states. These are often antistatic and should be able to hold printed circuit boards without components of adjacent boards touching @ various machines — small drilling machines, wire stripping machines, component lead forming machines, component lead cut-and-clinch machines and so on @ hand tools required for specific soldering job. Ambient lighting, temperature and humidity are also maintained, typically. Peripheral tools A range of hand tools is normally required in hand soldering. Actual tools depend on what type of assembly is to be soldered, but normally include: @ desoldering equipment — see later @ grounded wrist-straps — these form the cheapest and most cost-effective method control over static, preventing damage to sensitive components @ heat sinks — clip-on or squeeze-fit heat-sinks, to use when temperature- sensitive components are to be soldered @ IC insertion tools — special tools which hold integrated circuit legs in correct positions to enable simple insertion into printed circuit boards @ pliers — of several forms, typically miniature snipe-nose, round-nose, flat-nose and hook-nose, as well as larger snipe-nose and combination forms @ screwdrivers — insulated-handle screwdrivers of many sizes to fit flat blade and crossed blade screws @ sidecutters — short-bladed and close-cropping @ spanners — several forms are often required, typically open-ended, box, nut spinners @ trimming knives — with changeable, or snap-off blades @ tweezers — long-nosed tweezers to hold small components and leads @ wirestrippers — many types are available including manual forms with adjustable jaws, gutomatic forms with interchangeable jaw sizes, and special strippers for co-axial cable.', 'HAND SOLDERING 131\\n\\n132 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nHand soldering aids   Where  surface  mounted  components  are  being  soldered,  electrically-   heated  hot plates  may help to prevent damage  due to contraction.  Printed   circuit boards are placed on the hot plate and preheated before components   are placed and soldered, in this way, boards and components are all at more-   or-less the same temperature,  before,  during and after soldering.  Hot plates   can be used to cure and dry adhesive or solder paste, too, although they are   not common.   Magnifying  glasses, or  simple  microscope  arrangements  may  be  used,   also, as sight aids when  soldering  surface  mounted  components.   Generally, around the work area, it is useful to have inspection aids in the   forms  of posters, charts and so on,  illustrating good and bad points  in hand   assembly and  soldering.   Fume extraction   From a safety point of view, solder fumes should be removed from the work   area. This  can  be  done  with  a fairly  simple  fan  arrangement,  or  properly   extracted  by suction.   When extraction methods are chosen, it is common to have the extraction   point in the form  of a suction pipe placed immediately  above the soldering   iron  tip.  Many  soldering  irons  are  available,  complete  with  this  type  of   arrangement.   Flux and flux-cored solder   Soldering of any component to a printed circuit board  requires that flux be   added  prior to,  or at the same time  as, the molten  solder (see earlier).  This   Photo 7.1  Soldering  iron with   fitted solder fume extractor (Hi-   Tech  UK)  \\n\\nHAND SOLDERING 133   is always done, when  hand soldering, with flux-cored  solder wire; compris-   ing a wire of solder containing  cores along  its length, filled  with  flux.  Many   solder alloys  are available  in this form,  with  many types of flux,  and  many   wired  diameters.  For the  hand soldering of electronic  components;  alloy  is   at or close to the eutectic  composition  of tin  and  lead  (around  62%  tin  w   see Chapter  3), with  four to six cores of rosin or synthetic flux  (see Chapter   5),  with  a typical  diameter  of around  1 mm.   Electrostatically sensitive devices   Certain  electronic  components  are sensitive to electrostatic  discharge  (see   Table  7.1 ). When  hand  soldering  such  components  it is important to use a   soldering iron the tip ofwhich  is earthed, using a resistor of a minimum  value   of around  1 O0 kD.. This ensures any part of the soldering  iron tip  is at earth   potential  just  a  few  milliseconds  after  coming  into  contact  with  a  high   electrostatic  potential,  but also ensures that the discharge  is not sufficiently   fast to  damage  the component  at the  high  potential.

It is a tricky,  time-consuming,  operation   requiring some extra tools.  Operators  must be skilled  and fully trained.   First, the solder must be re-heated to be molten, then it must be removed,   prior  to  component  dismounting.  Molten  solder  can  be  removed  using   implements  to  suck  the  solder  away  from  a joint.  Solder  suckers  can  be   separate tools, or form  part of the soldering  iron,  comprising  an air-bulb or   plunger pump mechanism.  Sometimes complete desoldering stations com-   prising hand-held iron-type tools and bench-mounted  stations with  integral   pumps  are used.   Alternatively,  woven copper wire can be made into a braid, called solder   wick,  impregnated  with  flux,  which  has the  effect  of  drawing  the  molten   solder up the braid,  away from  the joint.   Mass CS soldering processes   The usual  mass CS soldering  process  is wave  soldering,  sometimes  called   flow  soldering;  drag  soldering  machines  are  less common;  dip  soldering   machines even  less so, although  there are some of both  types a r o u n d -   if   you look hard enough. One ofthe reasons why wave soldering machines are   generally  preferred  over  other  CS  processes  is  pretty  s i m p l e -   a  wave   soldering  machine  is  easily  included  as  part  of  a  continuous  electronics   assembly  production  line,  using straightforward  conveyor techniques. This   is,  no  doubt,  one  of  the  biggest  advantages  of  the  process.  Other  CS   processes need  more complicated  conveyor techniques.   Wave soldering CS processes are based on one of the oldest technologies   in soldering, and have been around in one form or another for more than 35   years (it was  invented  by Fry's Metals  in the  UK).  Yet wave soldering  is by   no means an outdated process, indeed, adaptations of the basic principle of   wave  soldering  seem able  to  cope  with  every  assembly  variant  designers   throw their way.   To date,  all  types of plated through-hole  assemblies  and  all  but a small   handful of surface mounted assemblies are successfully soldered using wave   soldering.  Further, wave soldering machine manufacturers are totally com-   mitted to upgrading the technology,  always making it able to cope with the   newest of miniaturized  components so, while  it is an old technology,  it still   holds  great  promise  for  the future.  Leaving  aside  any  doubts  about  wave   soldering  process  abilities  to  solder  some  surface  mounted  components,   common through-hole assemblies generally can't be soldered by SC solder-  \", '134 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nDesoldering\\n\\nMASS CS SOLDERING PROCESSES 135\\n\\nMASS CS SOLDERING PROCESSES 135 Photo 7.2 Wave soldering machine (c1960), capoble of soldering 250 mm wide assemblies. Note the modular construction popular with machine manufactur- ers at the time (Electrovert) ing processes, so for as long as through-hole components are used in assemblies wave soldering machines will be commonplace. Nevertheless, wave soldering does have drawbacks. It is a fairly compli- cated process, with some nine groups of variables [Klein Wassink, #4), requiring regular maintenance both during and between operations by experienced staff. Also, running costs are high. Other considerations are the peculiarities of the soldering process which affect circuit board design for successful soldering — more so than any SC soldering process does early design affect wave soldering stages. Wave soldering as a process Atypical wave soldering process is shown, in black diagram form, in Figure 7.4. There are three main parts, sometimes called stations, to the process: @ fluxing @ preheating @ soldering.

Inert atmosphere soldering One recent derivative of wave soldering is the use of inert atmospheres of nitrogen, in which assemblies are soldered. This could change the way we think about soldering processes, for the very simple reason that no longer is it necessary to use a classical flux to clean and maintain the metal surfaces to be soldered. Metal in an inert atmosphere does not oxidize, therefore the surface remains as solderable as it was before entering the inert atmosphere. without any requirement of an active flux coating. Given that the metal surfaces to be soldered are sufficiently clean and solderable in the first place, much less active fluxes — which consequently leave only few residues — may be used. These fluxes have been called preparation fluids, though are really types of no residue or low solids fluxes. The potential for inert atmosphere soldering applications goes even further, however. At the time of writing, it is apparent from early application trials that inert atmosphere soldering machines may, in some instances, be able to dispense with fluxes altogether [Elliott, 1991 #11]. No-flux assem- blies — meaning only minute amounts of residues, hence nocleaning — are now with us. We consider inert atmosphere CS processes later. Handling assemblies In an automated production line loading, conveyance and unloading of printed circuit boards through soldering machines is done with conveyors, of which there are two main types, based on: @ pallets @ fingers. Pallet conveyors By placing assemblies in a frame or pallet (either individually, or as a combination of assemblies in a larger part-punched board — sometimes called a biscuit board), the whole structure can be installed on a conveying system which passes it through all solder machine parts. Typically, pallet conveyors use a roller chain moving in a slot to provide controlled movement. Pins ina pallet engage between chain links; the pallet is moved with a positive drive which provides no slippage. Conveyor drives are considered later.', '136 cs SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nHANDLING ASSEMBLIES 137 Pallets are adjusted to fit assemblies with sliding bar or spring finger mechanisms. They must hold each assembly firmly and accurately, but without undue side force which might bend the printed circuit board at soldering temperature. For solder-cut-solder processes (in which each assembly is soldered, component leads are trimmed, then assemblies are soldered again) pallet conveyors are nearly always used as they give good support from vertical movement as assemblies pass through the cutter stage. Pallets with a fixed central bar or finger set, together with adjustable sliding mechanism either side, may be used to hold two assemblies. However, each pair of assemblies in these pallets must have similar thermal characteristics requiring identical soldering parameters. Tooling plates Assemblies with non-rectangular shapes, without at least two parallel sides for holding and location, must be held in pallets with tooling plates which are routed out to accept an assembly, leaving thin outside flanges for support. Tooling plates are often designed to hold several small assemblies (with similar thermal characteristics) simultaneously. Pallet guidelines There are several important aspects of pallets and tooling plates: @ they must be rigid and not be distorted in handling or exposure to soldering waves @ they must be square and level — check them regularly, say, once a week @ dropped pallets must be removed from service until checked @ they must not introduce contamination into solder. Thus aluminium pallets or tooling plates must be anodized or Teflon-coated (Teflon is a trade mark of Du Pont). Steel pallets or tooling plates must have a blued oxide finish or similar @ they must allow for expansion of the laminate (0.5 mm per side is general) @ pallet and tooling plate finish should be regularly checked. Pallets and tooling plates should be replaced if their finish is damaged, scratched or worn through @ the bottom plane of a pallet should be level with the bottom of the assembly it carries, to avoid the frame depressing the solder wave.'], api_base='http://localhost:8080/')\u001b[0m\n",

Not many years ago there were no computers, no CDs, no mobile   telecommunications,  and space travel was limited to science fiction --even   radio  networks  have  really  only  grown  up within  a lifetime.  Much  of the   technology  advances  of  our  age  have  been  made  possible  thanks  to  the   innovation  of the electronics  industry which,  with  its development of new   materials,  machines  and techniques,  continues  to grow on a global  basis.   We tend to take such things for granted,  but now developing countries too   are sharing in the electronics  boom.   With  further  miniaturisation,  increased  board  complexity  and  quality   becoming even more critical, expertise in soldering assembly is a prerequi-   site, for both  engineers and  new  recruits to the electronics  business.   Soldering  in  electronics  assembly  is  a  complex  skill,  relying  on  the   combination  of personal  expertise,  quality  materials,  and efficient  equip-   ment.  Quality  management  systems have  helped  raise the  production   yields,  while  equipment  and  materials  technologies  continue  to  keep   abreast of the industry requirements.  But behind all this are the engineers   and  it's they,  working  with  their suppliers,  who  are the  key players  in the   growth  of our  industry  in the future.

Soldering, as a principle  in electronics assembly, is straight-   forward  and simple m  two  metal surfaces (component termination  and a   connecting pad on printed circuit board track) are joined by metallic bonds   created by molten solder between them. Solder joints are supported by the   solder when  it solidifies,  and the solder allows electrical  contact between   metals in the joints.  Surface mounted components are changing, they are   becoming  smaller  and  lighter and  in the case of ICs due to the  increased   demands of functionality,  they also  have a greater number of  leads. This   dimensional  and  weight  change  is  driven  by  the  increase in  demand  of   portable  products.  Table  I  shows the  growth  in  unit  terms for  portable   products over the coming years.   The other sectors illustrated  harsh environment,  low cost/high value and   high  performance  cut across the traditional  market  boundaries and focus   more on the products technology requirement (Figure I).   Increasingly,  a number of companies are adopting one particular pack-   aging strategy m  that of small form-factor  components  ideal  for  portable   products.  These are  increasingly  being  used in  larger electronic  systems   such as exchanges, base stations etc  as a company  wishes to  adopt one   packaging strategy and hence assembly strategy for all types of products that   they manufacture.  This has obvious benefits with  regards to stock holding   Table  1 Total equipment quantities by global technology roadmap sectors 1997-2007   1997   2 0 0 2    2 0 0 7    x  lO 6   %   x  l O  6   %   x  lO 6   1710   4480   57.2   Portables   45.1   7480   %   !   63.3   High performance   460   12.2   840   10.7   990   8.4   Harsh environment   275   7.3   670   8.6   1190   10.0   Low cost, high volume   1340   35.4   1840   23.5   2160   18.3   Total   3785   1 0 0 . 0   7830   1 0 0 . 0    1 1 8 2 0   100.0  ', \"x PREFACE\\n\\nFigure 1  Global technology   roadmaps (BPA, 1998)   and handling of parts as well as set up time for assembly equipment such as   pick and place machines.

There  are  many  instances  where,  particularly  with  through   hole connectors,  these older technology products will  remain  due to costs   or  robustness.   Small  components  and  greater  lead  counts  make  soldering  to  printed   circuit  boards  more  and  more  difficult.  New  soldering  techniques  and   modifications  of existing techniques  are required to meet the challenge of   smaller surface  mount  and  minimalist  packages.   Our  job  in  writing  this  book  is to  show  all  this.  While  looking  at  the   principle of soldering, which has remained fixed since man first used molten   metal to join two other metals (first known use of solder is Roman pipework,   where sections of lead pipe were joined by melting their ends together),  we   also show  how  the techniques  to fulfill  the  soldering  process  can  change   and,  indeed,  are changing  with  the  requirements  placed  by  components   and printed  circuit  board  assemblies on them.   More than anything else these days (and in the future), state of component   and printed circuit board technologies means soldering has to be clean and   precise. In the distant past, when components were huge and printed circuit   board  tracks  were wide,  soldering was often  a case of throwing  sufficient   molten  solder  at a board  to  make  an  adequate  joint.  Joints  were  initially   made  by  hand.  This  is  no  longer  the  case.  With  minute  component   terminations  and tracks, too much  solder can be devastating. On the other   hand,  too  little  solder  will  not  make  a  joint  at  all.  Even  if  economic   considerations  were not important,  joints  can  no longer be made  by hand   because hand soldering cannot guarantee  adequate results with such small   joints. Control of soldering systems has to be precise and closely monitored.   Soldering and,  inevitably,  its control  must be performed  by machines.   While  it's  impossible  to  summarize  all  we  have  to  say, in  this  short   preface,  it  is possible to  make  a  list of  points  which  our  book,  hopefully,   spotlights.

It is, indeed,  a   simple process of bringing parts to be joined together with  solder, flux and   heat.  How  to do this and to achieve a satisfactory  result, though,  is both  a   science and an art, when each by itself may vary. Methods and the principle   used as years go by form  a most fascinating  subject.   Bob Willis,  Electronic Presentation Services   Solder is truly a magnificent trifle, it gets little respect from  management   yet it holds the entire electronics industry together. Thus another book on   soldering  is very welcome!   Howard  H  Manko,  Manko Associates   After nearly 4000 years, soldering  remains  as much  an art as a science.   Progress is still accelerating in this field of electronic technology, forcing us   m  again and  again m  to  rethink the  idea of quality.   Soldering first forged weapons, but now it may help us develop intelligent   machines towards  assisting  mankind  in  peaceful  pursuits.   Armin  Rahn,  rahn-tec Consultants   The more we know about soldering electronics assemblies,  the more we   discover  what  we  don't  know.  We  may argue about the  best solder fillet   shapes, the  benefits  of  controlling  the  solder  joint  microstructure,  or  the   required cleanliness  level of flux residues, but it is the practice of soldering   that is of the essence: almost anyone can solder - -   but few can solder well.   Colin  Lea, National Physical Laboratory   Printed  wiring  boards are the primary  means  of  interconnecting  circuit   components.  As  such  they  have  contributed  greatly  to  the  growth  of   electronics.  Assembly  and  connection  of  printed  wiring  b o a r d s -   also   called  printed  circuits  and  etched  w i r i n g -    involve  a sequence  of three   basic operations.  They are (1) manual  or automatic  insertion  of electronic   components,  (2)  metallurgical  joining  (soldering)  of  component  leads  or   terminals  to  printed  conductors,  and,  usually  (3)  a cleaning  operation  to   remove flux  and other  residual  contaminants.   In  view  of  the  interest  of  electronic  equipment  manufacturers  in  this   subject  and  the  increasing  importance  of  electronics  in  industry  and   elsewhere, a review of the state of the art as it currently exists and discussion   of the effects  of recent developments  in the field  are  in order.   Paul Bud (October  1980),  then  Vice President of Electrovert Inc  \", '1 Soldering process This chapter could be seen as just another introduction to soldering — it does, after all, explain in a fairly basic manner all important aspects of soldering in electronics assemblies. In this light many people may be tempted to skip it. However, this would be a mistake as it also explains philosophy behind the complete book. Further, it discusses main features and illustrates fundamental premises upon which we have based our text. Finally it also serves as a guide indicating where relevant and important information is to be found within the rest of the book. We strongly advise this chapter is looked at bearing all this in mind. Soldering, in principle though not in practice, is a reasonably straightfor- ward process, used in the electronics industry to bond components to- gether, forming one or more electrical connections. From this description, it’s easy to see that soldering serves two functions: @ mechanical support — holding components of an assembly together @ electrical support — forming required electrical connections within a circuit. Most components in an assembly use the mechanical support of soldered joints alone to give adequate fixing into the assembly. A few isolated components (notably, larger, heavier components) may require additional mechanical support, in the form of straps, nuts, bolts and so on. Where possible, however, such large components should be designed out (that is, care should be taken when designing a circuit not to use such components) of an assembly to keep extra procedures and cost to a minimum. On the other hand, all components may use solder as electrical support to form required electrical connections. No other method has yet been devised to take the place of solder in all assemblies to the same level of performance, cost and ease of operation.', \"2 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nTime  on  its  side   Solder in one form or another has been around for a long time. The Romans   are known to have used solder to form joints in their plumbing systems and,   indeed, the word plumbing refers to the use of lead (from the Latin plumbum   meaning  lead)  as a jointing  compound.  Nowadays,  of  course,  pure  lead   plumbing  is no  longer considered,  instead  solder m  which  is an  alloy  of   mostly tin and  lead - -   is used. It's interesting to note that certain countries   are already in the process of altering legislation to prevent lead being used   in any plumbing  where drinking water is present.   Solder has been adopted by the electronics  industry as the best method   of making joints within assemblies and, for many years, this jointing process   was undertaken manually--  hand soldering.  Inevitably hand soldering is a   slow,  laborious,  time-consuming  and  hence  expensive  process as  each   component  must  be  soldered  into  position  to  the  printed  circuit  board   individually. Quality and repeatability of joints depend almost totally on the   individual  operator.  This  clearly  makes cost  of  large-scale  electronics   assembly  production  uneconomical  and  unsatisfactory.  Generally,  there-   fore,  hand soldering of electronics assemblies is undertaken only in devel-   opment and prototype stages, although there remains a situation  in which   small-volume  production  of  electronics  assemblies is economical.  Hand   soldering is used regularly in  rework stages of manufacture,  where assem-   blies  need to  be  partially  disassembled  for  repair  and  service  purposes.   Because of this  situation  we  need to  consider  hand  soldering  and  so  it  is   discussed in Chapter 7.   For  the  last  40  years or  so,  various  methods  of  automating  soldering   processes  have  been  developed.  It's easy to  see  how  vitally  important   automated  soldering of assemblies has become,  by  remembering  that the   space programme  of  getting  a  man  on  the  moon  could  not  have  been   achieved without  it.   Paul Bud, to whom this book is dedicated, related an interesting fact about   NASA  printed  circuit  boards  used in  spacecraft.  Had  NASA's  assemblies   been hand soldered, joints would have held more solder with the result that   assemblies would have been 10% heavier. So many assemblies are used in   spacecraft that with  this additional  weight,  the three astronauts  (totalling,   say, 250  kg) could  not have been carried!   Until just recently, however ~  say, the last ten years ~  soldering of really   only  one type  of  electronics  assembly  was  in  the  main  undertaken.  This   assembly  type,  a  typical  joint  of  which  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.1,  is   commonly  called the through-hole printed  circuit  board,  simply because   the components feature leads which are inserted through holes in the printed   circuit  board.  Copper  track  interconnections  exist  between  holes  which  \", \"TIME ON ITS SIDE 3\\n\\nmake up the circuit of an assembly and component leads are soldered to the   copper,  so that  mechanical  and  electrical  support  is  provided  with  each   solder joint.  Note that,  in this ideal joint,  solder has been drawn  inside the   hole during the soldering operation mthis occurs by capillary action. Solder   between  the copper track  and the component  lead  is called  the fillet.   Emergence of a different type of electronics assembly m  surface mounted   assemblies or SMAs ~  however,  is altering the face of soldering processes   used. So much  is surface mount technology (SMT) changing soldering that,   at present, somewhere around 50% of all electronics assemblies use at least   a  few  surface mounted components (SMCs ~  also  sometimes  called   surface mounted devices or SMDs). In 1980 the figure was, to all practical   purposes outside  of Japan, zero. This  change  in  assembly technology  has   only  been  possible  with  developments  bringing  a  parallel  change  in   soldering technology. Changes in component technology, too, are pushing   many  companies  along the  surface  mount  route ~  a growing  number  of   components simply cannot be obtained in through-hole forms and are only   available  as surface mounted  components.

Differ-   ence  between  this  and  the  through-hole  assembly  joint  of  Figure  1.1  is   immediately  a p p a r e n t -   surface  mounted  assemblies  do  not  use holes to   locate component  leads prior to soldering.  Indeed,  surface mounted  com-   ponents do  not have  leads, a fact which  prompts  another descriptive term   for them  - -   leadless components - -   in  contrast with  components  used  in   through-hole assemblies which are often called leaded components. While   we're  defining  terms,  we  may  as  well  go  on  to  point  out  where  leaded   components  are  inserted into a printed  circuit board,  leadless  components   are  loosely said  to  be  onserted onto  a  board.   From  this  description  it's  easy  to  see  that  surface  mount  technology  is   based  on  a  marriage  of  standard  through-hole  techniques  with  hybrid   assembly  techniques  (hybrid  assemblies  are  those  in  which  film-based   components  are combined with  ieadless discrete components on a ceramic   or similar  substrate).   These  two  main  assembly  types  are  only  categories,  and  within  each   category there are many variations, each with specific solder joint concerns   and requirements.  Relevant variations,  joint types and solder processes are   detailed  in Chapter 2.   Figure 1.2  Soldered joints formed   between component terminals and   copper track on a surface mount   assembly printed circuit board  \", 'PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD 5 Printed circuit board Electronics assemblies are based on use of a printed circuit board of one form or another, to hold components. Construction of these printed circuit boards is critical to soldering processes, in that different printed circuit board types have different thermal characteristics, which can greatly affect how they must be soldered. In principle, a printed circuit board (PCB), sometimes called a printed wiring board (PWB), or simply printed board, comprises: a base, which is a thin board of insulating material supporting all the components which make up a circuit; conducting tracks, usually copper, on one or both sides of the base making up the interconnections between components. Compo- nent connecting leads are electrically connected in some form of permanent or semi-permanent way, usually by soldering, to lands, sometimes called pads — the areas of track specially designated for component connection purposes. If lands have holes drilled or punched through the board to facilitate component mounting, the board is a through-hole printed circuit board. If lands have no holes the board is a surface mounted printed circuit board. To clarify, the term printed is somewhat misleading, as tracks are not printed directly onto the board. It refers instead to just one stage within the whole printed circuit board manufacturing process, where the conducting track layout, sometimes called pattern or image, may be produced using some form of printing technique. Printed circuit boards can be made in one of two main ways. First, in an additive process, the conductive track may be added to the surface of the base material. There’s a number of ways in which this can be done. Second, in a subtractive process, where base material is supplied with its whole surface covered with a conductive layer, track pattern is defined, and excess conductive material is removed, leaving the required track. Sometimes, both processes may be combined to produce printed circuit boards with more than one layer of conductive track. Printed circuit board types There are three main categories of printed circuit boards: @ single-sided — in which copper track is on just one side of the insulating base material. In a through-hole single-sided printed circuit board (Figure 1.3a), components are situated on the non-track side of the circuit board while their leads go through the through-holes to the other side, where they are soldered to lands. In a surface mounted printed circuit board,\\n\\n6 SOLDERING PROCESS Hole through board Component Component lead / -— Base material Ar Solder” UL Land Hole through board Component | : Component leads Base | J be cg Track material N 6 tallized layers i -_ = b j Land Solder [7 Fe y (b) Plated through: ! holes (vias) ii Component on underside Component Through via RN Buried via Track N i. \\\\ \\\\ Metallized layers“ Solder Blind via Land U Metallized layer (c) Figure 1.3 Three main categories of printed circuit board (a) single-sided: track is present on only one side of the base and components are usually mounted on the other.

Vias are used to connect berween layers components — and their leads or terminals — are situated on the same side of the board as the copper track @ double-sided — in which copper track is on both sides of the insulating base material.

Where through-holes are required to interconnect top and bottom copper track layers, they are plated inside hole barrels with copper, and are called plated through vias. Where a component lead also goes through a via it is called a plated through-hole (PTHs). In a surface mounted double-sided assembly, components are on the same side as boards are soldered. Components may be mounted on both sides of the board. Note, however, a circuit track on one side of the board is not connected to track on the other side unless plated through-holes are used @ multi-layered — in which several circuit track layers are incorporated into a single board, laminated together with insulating layers between each copper layer. (Figure 1.3c). Plated through-holes can be used for either component terminal connection, or purely as electrical connections {in which case they are called vias). Vias passing from one outside track to the other are called through vias, while those connecting internal track layers are called blind, or buried vias. As many as 30 orso layers are typically made into a multi-layered printed circuit board of around 2 mm thickness. Maximum known to the authors is a board with 60 layers, although boards like this are unusual and very costly. Printed circuit board base materials There are many materials used to make printed circuit boards. Generally, for common applications, materials are of thermosetting or thermoplastic plastics, reinforced for rigidity. Reinforcement materials include sheet paper, glass fibre cloth, cotton fabric and nylon. Fillers can be added to influence characteristics. Table 1.1 lists common printed circuit board laminates, according to British Standard BS 4584 and IEC 249 classifications. Where applicable, classifications according tothe commonly known ANS! NEMA LI standard — which, incidentally, does not exist anymore — are also listed for information. To aid clarification of letter codes, Table 1.2 lists codes along with descriptions. Physical and electrical properties of printed circuit board are also standardized by BS 4548 and IEC 249. These are listed in Table 1.3. While the most common material in printed circuit board laminate production is currently woven glass fabric reinforced epoxide resin, it is worth noting that a trend towards flexible polyimide forms of printed circuit boards is taking place in many consumer products — purely for cost purposes. This trend is expected to continue.', '8  SOLDERING PROCESS   Table  1.1  Common  printed  circuit  board  laminate  materials,  listed  alpha-   betically  by  BS/IEC  laminate  code  classification.

Solders used for electronics assembly   melt at temperatures around 185~  or so, therefore quite simple equipment   (a soldering  iron,  say) can  be used to create individual  soldered joints.   Joints are formed by metallic  bonds between the metals  in the joint area   (usually the copper track of a circuit  board and component  leads) and the   solder.  Modern  solder  is an  alloy,  usually of tin  and  lead  (although  other   alloys  are occasionally  used, and  selected  impurities  may  be  added to  a   conventional  tin/lead  solder to  create  changes in  properties,  as required),  \\n\\n8 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.\\n\\n.', 'G-10, G-11, FR-4,\\n\\nX, XP, XPC, XX,\\n\\nXXP, XXPC, XXX,\\n\\nXXXP, XXXPC,\\n\\nfabric, copper conductor\\n\\nSoldering\\n\\nSOLDERING  9   Table  1.2  Letter codes for printed circuit board types   NEMA LI1   Description   Letter code   BS 4584/IEC249   I   I   II   Cellulose paper   CP   Copper conductor   Cu   EP   Epoxide resin   Flexible   F   Woven glass fabric   GC   Woven glass fabric with reinforce-   GCA   ments of non-woven glass filaments   Polyethylene terephthalate (polyes-   PETP   ter)   Phenolic resin   PF   Polyimide   PI   Silicone resin   Si   Flame retardant   FR   Glass fabric reinforced   G   Punchable, if heated to between 50   P   and 80~   PC   Cold punchable, above 25~   Paper reinforced, poor electrical   X   characteristics   XX   Paper reinforced, fair electrical   characteristics   Paper reinforced, good electrical   XXX   characteristics   which  melts at a lower temperature than either of the metals to be joined   this  means that  joints  can  be  made  to  metals  which  form  the  leads of   otherwise  quite  fragile  components.  Further,  the  reasonably  low  melting   point  means many joints  may  be soldered  at the same time with  little fear   of damaging components.  On the other hand, where many joints are to be   formed simultaneously,  equipment becomes  rather more elaborate,  simply   because  of the problems  associated  with  handling  solder  in  molten  bulk.   Note also that lead in solder may not have a very long life. Legislation may   exist in the long-term,  to prevent the use of lead as a constituent of solder.   The process of soldering only occurs on certain surfaces, usually metallic,   and  does  not  occur  on  insulating  surfaces-  this  means solder  may  be   applied  in excess. Alternatives  to soldering ~  welding,  conductive  adhe-   s i v e s -   require much more complex equipment.

In its simplest form, soldering is uncomplicated. Production of a soldered joint requires only that the parts to be soldered are positioned to remain relatively immobile. The surfaces are then heated to allow coverage with molten solder, and the solder is allowed to cool and solidify. However, controlling this process are five variables: @ flux @ wetting @ heat @ solderable surfaces @ time. Flux In most cases, a substance called flux is used in the process, primarily to clean thesurfaces to be soldered and so aid wetting. However clean they are, all metals (with the exception of the noble metals) oxidize to form an oxide layer on their surfaces. Other tarnish products may occur, too. Presence of any tarnish layer will prevent wetting. Flux reacts with the tarnish layers, leaving a pure base metal surface for the solder to wet. A secondary function of the flux is to reduce the solder’s surface tension, so increasing the solder fluidity and aiding wetting. Another is to protect the metal surface during subsequent heating. Heat Application of heat is a prime requirement of any soldering process: solder has a melting point of, typically, around 185 °C. So, to enable its application, the solder has to be heated to at least this temperature. This can be done, in the three extremes, by: @ heating the joint before solid solder is applied (for example, when hand soldering) @ heating the solder until molten before application to the joint (say, in wave soldering) @ applying solder to the joint, then heating both (say, simple infra-red soldering techniques). While techniques exist formed by just one of the three extremes, many', \"SOLDERING 11\\n\\n12  SOLDERING PROCESS   soldering  processes  are elaborate  mixtures  of two  or  all  three.   Note,  it is not a prerequisite  that the joint be  heated  prior to application   of  solder  although,  for  convenience,  it often  is.   Wetting   Wetting  is  the  process  in  soldering  where  the  solder  comes  into  direct   metallic contact with the metals to be soldered together into a joint, forming   a  specific  alloy  of solder  and  metal  at the junction.  In turn,  this  implies  a   joint's  metallic  surfaces  should  be  so  clean  that  metallic  contact  can  be   made.   Often, the term  intermetailic  is used to describe  the bond  which  occurs   between solder and metal when the solder wets the metal (as in intermetailic   bond).  This  is  incorrect:  it  is,  in  fact,  a  strict  metallurgic  term  referring to   intermetallic  compounds,  compounds  of elements  whose  atoms  have  an   so  high  an  affinity  that  their   extremely  high  affinity  for  each  other  ~   presence denies  bonding of other elements  by other  means.  To appreciate   the difference  between  intermetallic  compounds  and  alloys  it's  important   to  realize  that  intermetallic  compounds  have  fixed  stoichiornetric  ratios.   Alloys, on  the other  hand,  have  ratios of metals  which  can  vary.   Wetting occurs when  solder comes  into intimate contact with the metal   atoms.  If the  metal  surface  is perfectly clean  and  metal  atoms are  present,   then the solder wets the metal,  forming a bond  with the metal atoms at the   interface  (Figure  1.4).  Once  this  interfacing  bond,  an  intermetallic  com-   pound  as  it happens,  has  been  created  it cannot  be  removed.   If, on the other  hand,  the  metal  is unclean  in any way, say,  it is oxidized   (Figure  1.5)  such  that  metal  atoms  are  not  present  on  the  surface,  then   wetting cannot occur ~  in a s imi lar way to which a drop of water on a greasy   surface will  remain  as a  droplet.   Figure 1.4   Intimate contact   between solder and a metal surface   occurs when wetting takes place.   An  intermetallic compound is   formed at the interface between the   two  \", '12 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nSy ebay. ee Dae aa ee Solder / Interfacing alloy Base material\\n\\nFigure 1.5   If a  contaminant such   as oxide  is present on  the metal   surface prior to soldering,  no   intermetallic compound  is formed   so wetting  cannot take place   In context with the wetting of metals, two other terms need to be defined.   The first is non-wetting, where part or all ofthe metal to be soldered is devoid   of solder. Usually this occurs where a contaminant or oxide has been left on   the  metal  surface,  so preventing  the  necessary  alloy  bond  between  metal   and  solder  layer.  The  second  is  dewetting,  where  the  alloy  bond  has   occurred,  but  where  the  solder  withdraws  from  the  metal  and  forms   dispersed,  irregular droplets.  Further solder cannot accumulate  due to the   high  surface  tension  formed.  Where  dewetting  occurs,  it  is  sometimes   difficult  to determine;  a simple visual  check  may  not be sufficient.   Both  problems  are  usually  caused  by  lack  of  cleanliness,  although   dewetting can also occur when  large amounts of intermetallic  compounds   form.   Cleaning   There  are  two  areas in  which  cleaning  may  need  to  take  place  in  the   soldering process.  First, the metallic  surfaces to be soldered together must   be perfectly clean,  in order that solder can wet the metals involved. Second,   residues  left  after  soldering  may  need  to  be  removed.  These are  usually   cleaning.  Both  are discussed  in Chapter  I0.   Another pre-assembly area where cleaning  is important,  often out of the   hands of the assembler,  is cleanliness during board manufacture. Where an   assembler  simply  buys-in  ready-made  boards,  problems  of  cleanliness   during  manufacture  may  be difficult  to  isolate,  and  even  more  difficult  to   eliminate.  Cleanliness  of  ready-made  boards  is of vital  importance  when  \\n\\nSOLDERING 13\\n\\nBase material\\n\\nCleaning', '14 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\ncertain  fluxes  (those with  little  reactional  activity)  are used. Modern  trends   indicate  greater  usage  of  such  fluxes  in  the  future,  so  clean  boards  are   correspondingly  more  important.   Solderable surfaces   Solder will  only  join  certain  surfaces.  Generally,  in  electronics  assembly,   these surfaces are of just one main type of metal\" copper. (Occasionally  iron,   nickel  iron and brass parts are found  in assemblies.) Copper is, of course, an   Photo  1.1  Non-wetting,  showing   where copper surface is not wetted   at all, so surface is visible (Alpha   Metals)   Photo  1.2  Dewetting,  showing   surface which is originally wetted,   followed by withdrawal of solder,   leaving an alloy bond on the   copper surface (Alpha Metals)  \\n\\nSOLDERING  15   extremely good electrical conductor and so is ideal for the purpose.  It does,   however,  oxidize fairly easily in air and  is generally protected  somehow to   prevent  oxidation  (which  may  prevent  soldering  taking  place)  prior  to   soldering.   Ability  of  a  surface  to  be  completely  wet  by  solder  is  scientifically   measured as its solderability and the term is one of the most important in the   subject of soldering.  In other words,  it refers to how well  and  how uniform   the  interfacing  alloy bond  between  solder  and  metal  is made.   It fol lows that solderabil ity is concerned with every\\'aspect of the soldering   process  (ie, fluxing,  wetting,  heating,  cleaning),  and  the  main  aspects  of   board  manufacture,  too  (ie, copper  plating,  tin/lead  plating,  solder  resist   application).  Further,  solderability generally decreases with age, as tarnish-   ing of the  metals  involved  occurs  naturally  in  normal  atmosphere.   One of the major problems of guaranteeing  adequate  solderability  is the   difficulty  in  measuring  exactly what solderability  is.  Not so very long ago,   solder  joint  quality  (and  hence,  solderability  of the  metals  involved)  was   determined  by  an  over-simple  visual  check:  the  joint\\'s  brightness  and   smoothness  was thought an  indicator of joint quality.  Indeed,  it sometimes   still  is.  However,  modern  joints  on  surface  mounted  assemblies,  say,  are   Photo  1.3  A  computer-controlled   solderability  tester (Multicore)  ', \"SOLDERING 15\\n\\n16  SOLDERING PROCESS   rarely  bright  and  certainly  never  smooth,  yet  are  known  to  be  joints  of   perfect quality.   In effect,  solder joint quality can  never be determined  by appearance of   the outside layer of the solder. Actual  quality is determined  solely by what   has happened  at the  interface between the solder and the metal.  As this  is   impossible to view,  visual  inspection  consequently serves little purpose in   assuring  joint  quality.  More  cohesive  tests for  solderability  and  for  joint   quality are discussed  in  Chapter 3.   Once a board or component is known to have an acceptable solderability,   it is usual to coat it with  a substance  known  as a protective  coating,  in an   attempt to maintain  solderability.   Protective coatings come  in many forms,  but their simple task is to cover   the copper with a layer of material which doesn't oxidize so readily, yet still   allows copper to be soldered to. This is only an attempt,  note, as no coating   can  maintain  solderability  indefinitely.  Extent to  which  solderability  de-   creases  under  storage  conditions  depends  primarily  on  the  protective   coating  used, but  also  on  the  storage conditions  and  the  thicknesses  of   coatings, so estimates of solderable iifespans, that is, shelf-life,  can only be   approximate.  Boards  should  be  re-tested for  soiderability  after  storage,   before  use. Protective coatings  are discussed  in Chapter  3.   Soldering processes   A  number  of  methods  exist  by  which  electronics  assembly  soldering   processes may be categorized, the first is whether soldering is performed by   hand  or by machine.   Hand soldering   Hand soldering  is usually performed  alongside hand assembly.  It involves   use of purpose-built tools and specific operations, which  depend primarily   on the components being soldered. As a complete process, hand soldering   is discussed  later  in Chapter  7.   Machine soldering   Machine  soldering  methods  are, very  simply,  methods  to  solder  compo-   nents into or onto a board  en masse. For this reason, they are often called   mass soldering methods.  Primary aim of mass soldering methods is to speed   up the manufacture  of electronics  assemblies.   Another method  by which  soldering processes may be categorized  is by   the  mass soldering  process  used. There  are two  main  categories  of  mass   soldering  processes:  \", \"16 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nSOLDERING PROCESSES 17   Q  those processes which  rely on the insertion or onsertion of components   prior to  application  of solder m  from  here called  component/solder  (CS)   processes  m  sometimes,  graphically,  called  flow  or  wave  soldering   processes   Q  those  processes which  rely  on  the  onsertion  of  components  after the   application  of solder ~  from  here called solder/component  (SC) processes   sometimes  called  reflow  soldering  processes.  The  term  reflow  is,   however, a misnomer as it implies previously molten solder is reheated until   molten  once more.  In many cases a solid form  of solder in a paste mixture   is  used in  SC  soldering  processes which,  correctly  therefore,  cannot  be   referred  to as reflow  processes.   At this point it's worth reinforcing what we've just stated. We're introducing   new  terms  into  an  area already  crowded  with  expressions  describing   various  applications  and  processes in the soldering  of electronics  assem-   blies. All  we're trying to do with  these new terms  is to clarify the complex   area.   Put simply: all types of soldering processes for all types of assemblies can   be  categorized  in  just  two  groups  ~  CS  soldering processes and  SC   soldering processes.   CS soldering processes   CS soldering processes position components onto the printed circuit board   then  apply solder.   $C soldering processes   SC soldering  processes, on  the other  hand,  apply  solder  before  positioning   components  onto  printed  circuit  boards.  \\n\\nSOLDERING PROCESSES 17\\n\\n18 SOLDERING PROCESS Figure 1.6 A simple form of dip soldering — lowering and remov- ing the printed circuit board near- horizontally Component/solder (CS) processes There are three main CS soldering processes: @ dip soldering @ drag soldering @ wave soldering. Dip soldering in dip soldering processes the assembled board is fluxed then lowered near- horizontally, into a bath of molten solder as shown in Figure 1.6. Once the lower edge of the board comes into contact with the solder, the board is dropped to a horizontal position on top of the solder. After a suitable period during which the solder achieves wetting over the whole of the areas to be soldered, one edge of the board is lifted (usually the edge which first came into contact with the solder), then the whole board is lifted clear of the bath. Dip soldering suffers from problems in that flux gases are easily trapped under the board and, as a consequence, contact times must be quite tong {about 10 seconds) to ensure adequate wetting and solder temperature must be quite high. Solder Drag soldering By dragging the assembled and fluxed board over the surface of molten solder (illustrated in Figure 1.7), the problems associated with dip soldering processes can be overcome. Consequent contact times are much shorter (about 5 seconds). Wave soldering Wave soldering processes use a pump to create a wave of solder over which the assembled and fluxed board is passed (illustrated in Figure 1.8). Contact times of only 2 to 4 seconds are usual, and required solder temperature is lowered.\", \"18 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\nDip soldering\\n\\nSolder\\n\\nFigure 1.7  Drag soldering,  in   which a printed circuit board is   dragged over the surface of molten   solder   Dip and drag soldering processes are older than wave soldering processes   and,  although  both  are  still  used, neither  normally  forms  the  preferred   method  in  most  applications.  For  mass  CS  soldering,  wave  soldering   techniques  are the  norm  and are discussed  in  depth  in Chapter  7.   Figure 1.8  Conveying  the board   over a wave of solder allows much   shorter contact times and lower   temperatures w  the wave soldering   principle   Solder/component (SC) processes   SC soldering processes are used, primarily,  in  surface mounting  assembly   production,  where  solder and flux  are applied  as a paste followed  by the   placement  of  components  and  the  application  of  heat  (Figure  1.9).  SC   soldering  processes  are  often  termed  reflow  processes, known  as  such   because  the  original  idea  uses a  layer  of  previously  applied  solid  solder   which  is reheated to  cause it to  melt,  that  is, flow,  again.   Under this light, the term reflow as it is often currently used is something   of a misnomer,  as we've  already discussed.  This  is simply  because  solder   and  flux  paste  ~  now  the  normal  method  of  applying  solder  before   components  are  assembled  m  in  no  way  can  be thought  of as solid  and  \\n\\nSOLDER/COMPONENT/(SC) PROCESSES 19\\n\\nBoard direction\\n\\n——————> Board direction ——» ] 4 Solder wave\", \"20 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\npreviously  molten  solder.  Further,  soldering  processes can't  be  classified   simply  by  the  two  different  assembly  types  of  through-hole  and  surface   mount designs, because some surface mount assemblies  use CS processes.   Likewise,  it  is feasible - -   though  not currently  usual  - -   for some through-   hole assemblies  to be soldered  by SC means.

By 1994,  in fact, some intend   to have already implemented this, and will  no longer use CS wave soldering   methods at all.   Mass  SC  soldering  techniques  are  generally  categorized  by  type  and   direction of applied heat. These are all discussed (including through-hole SC   processes) in  Chapter 8.   Cleaning   While  cleanliness of electronics  assemblies  is an asset which  all  manufac-   turers  should  strive for,  never has it been  so important  as in  production  of   modern densely-populated  printed circuit  boards. The smaller the compo-   nents are which  are  located on a printed  circuit  board,  and the closer they   are together, the harder it becomes to ensure they are totally clean after all   manufacturing  processes ~  particularly  soldering.   Environmental  concerns regarding the damage which  certain chemicals   do to the ozone  levels  in earth's atmosphere  has restricted the use of those   chemicals.  In a short time (ie, by the end of the century, say) those chemicals   and  indeed some others which  may have otherwise been considered as   alternatives  ~  will  not  be  available  for  use  at  all  as  cleaning  agents.   Consequently,  manufacturers  need to ensure cleaning agents which  cause   no danger to our environment  are used in  cleaning  processes.   Chapter  10  discusses this  cleaning  dilemma  in  electronics  assembly   manufacture,  and describes all  cleaning  processes.   Quality   Given  that  a  circuit  is  properly  designed,  component  parts are  of  good   quality  and  printed  circuit  boards  are  assembled  correctly,  then  solder   processes  hold  the  fundamental  key  to  an  assembly's  quality.  Modern   machine soldering equipment is capable of tremendous achievement, much   ofwhich  is under automatic control. While things work properly and perfect   zero-defect assembled printed circuit boards are coming off the production   line,  everybody's  happy.   But what happens if things go wrong? How do you tell  if a particular fault   is related specifically to your solder machine or to peripheral equipment and   processes? There are so many variables in production  of electronics assem-   blies  ~  particularly  in  the  soldering  process  part  ~   that  it  is  often  not   possible to  isolate the  problem  and  effect a cure.   Answers are not always easy to come  by and  so for this reason we  have   attempted  to  make  things  just  a  little  less complicated  with  Chapter  11,  \", 'Cleaning\\n\\nQuality\\n\\n22 SOLDERING PROCESS\\n\\n22 SOLDERING PROCESS which considers the question of solder process quality. In it, some examples are used to illustrate some of the main problems which occur in finished electronics assemblies. We think they form a unique collection of visual aids to assist in the identification of solder process-specific problems. Safety Soldering of electronics assemblies, indeed the whole assembly process, is a potentially dangerous procedure. You have to remember any industrial process can be lethal. Equipment in electronics assembly is often used with solvents which may be poisonous or explosive. Materials used are often flammable. In many assembly processes, particularly soldering itself, heat is a hazard when combined with these solvents and materials. Solder itself is a lead alloy, so can cause lead poisoning. In molten form solder, need we say it, is hot — very hot— usually at temperatures between 200°C and 350°C in, say, operational wave soldering systems! It can severely burn skin, and will burn through non-protective clothing to get to skin. Most equipment is of a mechanical nature, with moving parts: pulleys, sprockets, pumps, chains and so on. Fingers, hair, neckties, bracelets and so on can easily get caught in moving parts. Mechanically, these moving parts are very strong and may not be stopped simply by a trapped person trying to pull out an object caught in the machine. Serious physical injury can result. All equipment is electrically-powered. High voltages are present in various system parts. At best electric shocks make you jump. Often they cause burns and severe bodily harm. At worst they stop the heart and so kill. Safety is of vital concern to all personnel involved in soldering processes. Consequently, in Appendix 3, we consider specific safety aspects: describ- ing hazards and possible effects; suggesting ways to avoid them; and detailing first aid which may be required within the varied aspects of soldering. However, these are only items of immediate interest in soldering processes. It is strongly recommended that relevant and sufficient safety procedures be laid down and closely followed at all stages of electronics assembly. Three highly important points regarding safety throughout manu- facturing are: @ follow suppliers’ manuals and instructions closely @ invest in proper safety training @ keep up-to-date with control of substances hazardous to health regula- tions regarding such aspects as safety, materials use, materials storage.', \"Safety\\n\\n2  Electronics assemblies   It's the purpose of this chapter to itemize what main processes are available   in electronics assemblies, and how soldering systems cope with this wide   variety. To do this, we look at electronics assemblies in two ways. First we   consider  assemblies in terms of solder  joints.  For example,  what types of   joints  are  used in  electronics  assemblies and  what  are  their  strengths,   weaknesses, physical  constraints  and anomalies.   Having done this we, second, consider the main variations of electronics   assembly techniques which soldering systems have to cope with n o w ~   and   must cope with  in the near-future.  This we do by looking at combinations   of assembly techniques and components  used.   Joints   For electronics  assemblies there are two  main  categories of joints:   II  through-hole joints   II  surface mount joints.   Within  each category,  though,  there  are  a  few  variations.  Differences   between them  lie not only in obvious factors such as whether components   have leads or terminations, whether holes exist in the printed circuit board,   and  size  (albeit  important  differences)  but  in  a more  obscure  attribute  of   strength.   Whatever  the  category  of  joint  and  whether  through-hole  or  surface   mount components are jointed, there remain just four simple types of solder   joint of interest in electronics assemblies:   II  butt--  a straightforward wetted mating of two end surfaces of metal by   solder  \\n\\n24 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\n24 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES Figure 2.1 Four simple rypes of solder joint (a) butt, (b) single overlap, (c) double overlap, (d) ring and plug @ single overlap — where two plates of metal overlap, and solder wets the two touching surfaces. Overlap joints of single or double form are also commonly known as lap joints @ double overlap — where the joint comprises three metal plates, one within the space formed between two others @ ring and plug — in which a ring of meta! and a corresponding plug are jointed. These are illustrated in Figure 2.1. Strength Mechanical strength is a most important criterion when designing soldered joints. Obviously the joint should be strong enough to withstand all possible stresses it may experience: usually tensile, shear or a combination of both. On the other hand, there is little need to design a joint simply to be technically strongest. A knowledge of use of an assembly after manufacture is thus necessary at the first development stages, in order that correct joint types may be incorporated, strong enough to make the product retiable yet not so strong as to make it inordinately expensive. Insofar as measuring mechanical strengths of solder joints, the practice is largely a matter of testing these four joint types to destruction and collating results, Naturally, certain assumptions are taken regarding whether joints depend totally on tensile or shear strength or not. TREE BOTS TE\", 'Strength\\n\\nTREE BOTS TE\\n\\nTensile strength   The joint which  relies most on tensile strength for its function  is a butt joint.   It is the simplest joint form  and solder in the joint  is theoretically  stressed at   90 ~ to  its interfaces,  thus  is the best indicator  of maximum  tensile  strength   of a solder joint.   As stress occurs  at 90 ~ to joint  interfaces,  strength  is high;  Thwaites  and   Duckett  [Thwaites,  1976  #1]  report  measured  strengths  of  9.4  kgf  mm -2.   Strength  does  however  vary  considerably  with  solder  thickness  (ie,  joint   gap).  Figure 2.2  shows variation  of tensile strength for solder thickness  in a   standard butt joint.  Interestingly tensile strength of butt joints  is greater than   that of bulk  solder  (3.5  kgf mm-2), also shown  on the graph  for  reference.   Shear strength   Remaining  three  joint  types  are  felt,  by  Thwaites  and  Duckett,  to  more   closely  demonstrate  shear strength,  with  ring  and  plug  even  more  so than   the others. A shear strength of 3.7  kgf mm -2 is typical  in a ring and plug joint,   while the overlap joint has a joint strength of 4  kgf mm -2 - -   which  indicates   other strengths exist in an overlap joint.  This is probably due to the fact the   two  metal  plates cannot  lie  in the same plane as they are offset (part of the   joint design), so while shear strength is initially measured as load is applied,   twisting  of the joint  adds some tensile strength  into the result.  Interestingly   double  overlap  joints  are typically  less strong than  single  overlap  joints.

Finally, joint strength also varies with soldering temperature, as shown in   Figure  2.4,  where  overlap,  ring  and  plug,  and  butt  joint  strengths  are   compared.

To put this in perspective, peel strengths of typical printed circuit boards are such that copper track peels from a circuit board if a force of just a small fraction of possible solder joint tensile strength is applied over the few square millimetres of a soldered joint. In effect, materials surrounding a perfectly made joint usually form a limit to a solder joint — not the joint itself. Through-hole joints Through-hole joints rely on the single fact that a wire lead is inserted through a hole in the board, then soldered to bond to a metal track. However, certain factors may differ and affect the exact type of joint, such that four different types of through-hole joint have been specified by previous authors: @ non-plated through-hole, straight lead @ non-plated through-hole, clinched lead @ plated through-hole, straight lead @ plated through-hole, clinched lead. In the following discussion, it is assumed that all joints are perfect, with good, continuous, wetting al! round the area. Non-plated through-hole, straight lead Figure 2.5 shows the joint obtained when a straight component lead is soldered in a non-plated through-hole, such as would be obtained in a single-sided circuit board. This is the easiest through-hole joint to manufacture, as few processes, apart from insertion and soldering, are called for. It is, correspondingly, the weakest through-hole joint, however. Seen in cross-section as in Figure 2.5 it’s clear the joint is similar to the ring and plug joint discussed earlier, which basically depends on shear strength of a solder joint for its strength, so can be expected to have strengths of at least 3 kgf mm”.\\n\\n28 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.5  Non-plated through-   hole, straight lead printed circuit   board joint   Non.plated through.hole, clinched lead   This  joint  configuration  is  shown  in  Figure 2.6,  for  a  lead  clinched  at  a   nominal 45 ~ angle to the horizontal. Now, part of the joint is the same as the   non-plated through-hole,  straight lead soldered  joint,  so will  have around   3  kgf  mm 2  strength from  shear strength  of  solder  joints.  However,  the   remaining  part  of  the  joint  (between  clinched  lead  and  board)  acts as  a   considerable reinforcement, relying on compression of solder anc~/4mechanical   support  of the  component  lead  against  the  printed  circuit  board,  greatly   increasing overall joint strength.   Plated through.hole, straight lead   This joint  is shown  in  Figure 2.7.  Effects of the metallized  plated through-   hole are to allow solder to be drawn  up into the barrel of the hole, around   the lead. This has the effects of increasing strength and decreasing the joint's   electrical  resistance, compared  with the non-plated through-hole,  straight   lead  joint  of  Figure  2.5.

Plated through-hole, clinched lead   By far the strongest through-hole joint, this is shown in Figure 2.8. It includes   the strength of the reinforcement joint between clinched lead and board and   the shear strength of a ring and plug type of soldered hole barrel, together   with  lower joint electrical  resistance of the soldered barrel.   An  important  consideration  in  all  joints  is  the  hole-to-lead  size ratio   (commonly  known,  among  other  things,  as  the  stick-in-a-bucket  ratio),   which  has a large effect on joint strength and ease of assembly. Generally,   closer the lead diameter is to hole diameter, stronger is the joint, while the   opposite  is true for ease of assembly. Table 2.1  lists typical joint strengths   as percentages of maximum  possible joint strength for clearances between   leads and hole, against ease of insertion, for straight leads. Figure 2.9, on the  \\n\\n30 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.7  Plated through-hole,   straight lead printed circuit board   joint   other  hand,  shows  how  joint  strength can  be  expected  to  decrease for   increasing clearance between lead and hole diameters.

If joint strength at this clearance (about 80% of maximum) is insufficient, it is advisable not to decrease hole diameter (thereby decreasing lead-to-hole clearance and making insertion more difficult), but to clinch the lead instead, prior to soldering.

There  are  three   considerations.  First,  if  leads  are  clinched  too  close  to  horizontal,  plated   through-holes  may be physically damaged (Figure 2.10a). Second, clinched   leads with  angles  less than 45 ~ from  horizontal  require asymmetrical  lands   (Figure 2.10b).

Where   leads  are  clinched  in  closing  directions  (Figure  2.1 l a)  solder  bridges  can   often occur.  It is generally  best to specify that leads are clinched  inwards for   any single component  (Figure 2.1 1 b) or in the same direction  (Figure 2.1 1 c)   to  ensure  possibility  of solder  bridging  between  component  leads  is mini-   mized.

Good soldering (Alpha Metals) damage is far more likely to occur because copper track peels away from the printed circuit board. Plated through-holes and, more particularly, clinching of leads form the best solutions where this is a possibility. Surface mounted components A number of component types has been developed specifically for use in surface mounted assemblies. New types are frequently being developed, too, so any categorization of those available must change just as frequently. Types The main types, some known simply by their abbreviation, include: @ chips — in this context, the term chip does not refer to an integrated circuit, but to a type of passive component (eg, resistor, capacitor, inductor), rectangular prism shape @ MELF — metal electrode face bonded components, cylindrical shape @ MIFI — miniature ferrite inductors, rectangular prism shape @ SO— small outline components, generally integrated circuits of rectan- gular prism shape @ SOD — small outline diodes, cylindrical shape ®@ SOIC — small outline integrated circuits, rectangular prism shape @ SOT — small outline transistors, rectangular prism shape @ QFP — quad flat-pack integrated circuits having four rows of terminals, rectangular prism shape ® TA8 — tape automated bonding, sometimes called mikropacks, film integrated circuits in taped form, without protective packaging\\n\\nTypes\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES Figure 2.12 Outline shapes of some common surface mounted components @ tubular — passive components, cylindrical shape @ VSO — very small outline components. in addition, some integrated circuits are mounted into chip carriers, where the term chip does now refer to an integrated circuit, for assembly purposes. These carriers include: @ {CCC — leadless ceramic chip carriers, square prism shape @ PLCC — plastic leaded chip carriers, square prism shape. General outline shapes of some of these components are shown in Figure 2.12. Dimensions of versions of surface mounted components and chip carriers are found in manufacturers’ literatures.

A  joint  in  such  an   arrangement  is  a  simple  overlap  joint  which,  as  seen  earlier,  can  have  a   shear strength  of much  more than  3 kgf mm -2. The joint  is fairly  rigid, there   being no greatly flexible  parts to the arrangement,  so it is commonly  called   a  rigid  lap  joint.

These  leads ensure  the  overlap  joint  formed   between termination  and copper land is a little more flexible than the rigid   lap joint.  For this reason such a joint  is called a compliant  lap joint,  though   more commonly  is known  as a gull-wing joint.

Due to their shape,  components  with  such joints  are called  J-lead compo-   nents. A J-lead joint  has a tensile strength of at least 5 kgf mm -2. It is, due to   its short nevertheless flexible termination, another compl iant surface mounted   component joint.   Another surface mounted butt joint is shown in Figure 2.16.  It is not made   with  a conventional  surface mounted component,  though,  instead a more-   or-less  standard  dual-in-line  packaged  integrated  circuit  is  adapted  by   cropping  its terminals  so the device  sits on  surface  mount  lands.

J-lead joints are usually classed   as a different joint form.   Table 2.2  gives a comparison of vital statistics of the four typical surface   mounted  component joints,  together with  those of a non-plated through-   hole straight lead joint. While land areas and, hence, strengths of the surface   mounted component joints are considerably less than those of the through-   hole  joint,  they  are  still  more  than  amply  sufficient  to  maintain  them  in   position  on the printed circuit board.

These are on a scale of one to five, with five showing   best characteristics.   Surface mount joint  failure   Obviously, like through-hole component joints, strengths of surface mounted   component joints are not limited by the tensile or shear stress encountered   on the joints from  the components themselves.  Similar to joint  strength  in   through-hole joints which, in reality, is quite large (far larger, in fact, than the   strength of the circuit board materials surrounding the joint), the type of joint   possible when soldering surface mounted components is also considerably   stronger than  everyday forces  likely to occur  directly on the components.   Instead, however, it is the printed circuit board base material which is more   likely to bear the brunt of forces.   The problem arises simply because of the very small  land which a surface   mounted component is soldered to. Copper foil adhesion strength is no more   than 20 kgf cm -1 [Murata, 1988 #2] on typical printed circuit board--  much   less than  the tensile  or  shear stresses joints  themselves  can  withstand.  In   effect, even the slightest shear force on a joint can pull the land off the printed   circuit  board surface.

Mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion Any differences in thermal coefficients of expansion between a component and the printed circuit board base material will mean, on heating prior to soldering, both component and board expand (Figure 2.17a) then, on cooling after soldering, component and circuit board shrink by different amounts. If the amount is great enough, stresses are set up which pull lands underneath the component terminals from the board’s surface (Figure 2.17b). How much this effect limits use of surface mounted components depends initially on the type of component. Components whose terminals form rigid lap joints, for example, suffer most from this effect, as there is no compliance built-in to the arrangement. A general rule-of-thumb is used when soldering rigid lap jointed surface mounted components (generally those commonly called chip components) to epoxy resin-bonded, fibre glass reinforced circuit boards; which allows use of components upto about 6 mm in length. Many surface mounted components are within this size limit so lands remain unaffected by thermal coefficient of expansion mismatch.', \"J-lead cropped lead\\n\\n42 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nFigure 2.17  Showing how a mis-   match of thermal coefficients   between surface mounted   components and printed circuit   board base can cause damage on   cooling after soldering   Many other rigid lap surface mounted components (leadless chip carriers   form the main group),  on the other hand, are larger than 6 mm.  Such rigid   lap jointing  of these components  to epoxy resin-bonded,  glass fibre  rein-   forced circuit board is not, therefore, possible and in the long run an ultimate   solution  can  only  be  in  use of  printed  circuit  board  base materials  with   thermal coefficients of expansion matching those of rigid components (eg,   ceramic,  metal-bonded).   On  the  other  hand, compliant  lap  and  compliant  butt jointed  surface   mounted  components  larger than  6  mm  do  not  suffer from  any thermal   coefficient mismatch  problem.   Small  outline  diodes  (SODs),  small  outline  transistors (SOTs), small   outline  integrated  circuits  (SOICs), very  small  outline  integrated  circuits   (VSOICs), tape automated bonded integrated circuits (TABs), and so on are   all  components  having  compliant  lap  terminations.  Similarly,  compliant   butt jointing  of components  is obtained with  such components  as plastic   leaded chip carriers (PLCCs). As surface mounted components are known   for their advantage of being leadless, this  is something of a backward step,   not to mention a misnomer,  but does form a short-term solution to a tricky   problem.  \\n\\nComponent terminal \\\\ Solder Ves paste Component Component expands setatenate PRE / Copper land Printed circuit boerd expands Printed circuit board base matenal Component contracts Printed circuit board contracts more\\n\\nFigure 2.17 Showing how a mis-\\n\\nASSEMBLY VARIATIONS 43 Study of the soldered joint, in the context of through-hole and surface mounted components, in this manner is forcing a re-appraisal of the use of solder in electronics assembly. The comparatively low strength of the surface mounted joint appears to be of only minor concern. In effect, compliant lap and butt joints illustrate a successful short-term method of enabling surface mounted components, in quasi-leaded form, to be used with cheaply produced circuit board materials. In the long-term, though, the only solution to enable pure leadless surface mounted assembly must be to develop cheap and easy manufacture of thermally matched circuit boards, or to develop newer bonding processes with significantly improved shear strengths. Assembly variations Having considered all types of solder joints, if we now look at categories of electronics assemblies and consider joint types within them we can form an idea of all possible requirements which are made of soldering processes. This is a useful thing to do, as from it we'll be able to deduce which soldering processes are best suited to particular assembly types and applications. From all assembly methods in general use, we can work out a number of assembly categories. These are listed here, as varieties of component types: @ through-hole components on one side @ surface mounted components on one side @ surface mounted components on both sides @ mixed assembly (ie, through-hole and surface mounted components on one assembly), surface mounted components on one side @ mixed assembly, surface mounted components on both sides. Figure 2.18 illustrates all categories as cross-sections of printed circuit boards. Within each category there are different variants, which obviously affect soldering processes used to a large degree. Consequently we need now to look more closely at each category. Through-hole components on one side Assembly of through-hole printed circuit boards comprises two main processes: @ inserting leaded components @ soldering component leads to the printed circuit board copper track.\", \"ASSEMBLY VARIATIONS 43\\n\\n44  ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES   Figure 2.18  Five variants of electronics assemblies,  shown  in cross-section  (a) through-hole components on one side (b)   surface mounted components on one side (c) surface mounted components on both sides (d) through-hole and surface   mounted components on one side (e) through-hole and surface mounted components on both sides   Figure 2.19  Typical assembly   method for through-hole printed   circuit boards,  using a CS solder-   ing process   Figure 2.20  Possible  basis for assembly of through-hole printed circuit   boards with an SC soldering process  \\n\\n44 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\nApplication of solder paste Insertion of leaded components Drying of solder pasie a SC soldering\\n\\nInsertion of leaded components CS soldering\\n\\nA  typical  assembly  method  for  through-hole  printed  circuit  boards  is   detailed  in  Figure  2.19.  Quite  naturally,  basic  through-hole  assembly   soldering  is seen to  be a CS process  ie,  components-before-solder.  Typi-   cally,  mass solder techniques are of wave solder formats,  but dip and drag   systems are possible and a few are used.   On the other hand, SC soldering processes of through-hole assemblies are   possible m  an example  is shown  in  Figure 2.20 --it's  just that they don't   often  exist in  practice.  However,  there  is a situation  (mixed  assemblies   see later) where  SC soldering of  leaded  components  is justified.   Surface mounted components on one side   Both CS and SC soldering processes may be used to solder assemblies ofthis   category.  Differences  are fairly  minimal.   Surface mounted  components  on  one side,  SC soldered   Figure 2.21  Surface  mounted   components  on  one  side,  SC   This is, in terms of the number of steps, the most straightforward  method of   soldered   manufacturing  surface mounted assemblies, shown  in Figure 2.21.  For this   reason,  it  forms  an  entry  point  into  the  manufacture  of  surface  mounted   assemblies  for  many companies.   Solder  paste is  first  applied  to  the  board  in  a  pattern  which  matches   positions of the terminations of components to be placed. Components are   then placed onto the board, the paste is dried and the board  is heated in an   SC soldering process. Typically, drying of solder paste occurs in preheating   stages of soldering processes, so drying and soldering are often thought of   as a single operation.   Application  of solder paste is most often  undertaken  in a screen-printing   process  of  some  kind.  However,  other  methods  are  used, too.  It  is  a   sufficiently important topic to warrant a section of its own and is considered   in depth  at the end of this chapter.   Surface mounted  components  on  one side,  CS soldered   Although  slightly  more  complex  than  the  previous  variation,  use of a CS   soldering process means companies with existing through-hole production   facilities  (which  include a wave soldering  machine)  may be able to adapt   production  lines  to  manufacture  surface  mounted  assemblies.

This stage is followed  by component  placement.   Then,  adhesive  is cured,  the  board  is inverted,  and wave  soldering  of the   assembly  follows.   Surface mounted components, on both sides   Double-sided  surface  mounted  assemblies  usually  require  soldering  by   both  SC  and CS soldering  processes, in  sequence.  Thus,  for  a  company   contemplating  entry  into  surface  mounted  assembly  manufacture,  it  is   comparatively  expensive.   As  shown  in  Figure  2.23,  the  method  of  manufacture  for  this  type  of   assembly is simple addition of the two previous variations. Initially, compo-   nents on the top of the board  must be soldered  first.  Application  of solder   paste is followed  by component placement,  paste drying and SC soldering.   Next, components on the other side of the board are placed and soldered.   So, the board  is inverted, adhesive is applied,  components are placed, and   the adhesive  is cured.  Following  another board  inversion,  wave soldering   is undertaken.   There is an alternative to this method,  using two sequential  SC soldering   processes, illustrated  in Figure 2.24. This is a very cost effective  method of   production  with  high  yields.  Although  at first sight  it  might  seem compo-   nents soldered  in the first soldering operation  will  fall  off the board  as it is   soldered a second time, this is not so because surface tension holds them in   place.   This is a cheaper method than that of Figure 2.23, simply because a single   SC  process  is  used twice,  rather  than  separate CS  and  SC  processes.   Purchase of a CS system is thus avoided. Naturally, this is a popular method.   Mixed assembly, surface mounted components on one side   Here,  there are four  manufacturing  variants.  First is shown  in  Figure 2.25,   where leaded components are inserted  into the board, the board is inverted,   adhesive  is  applied,  surface  mounted  components  are  placed,  and  the   adhesive  is  cured.  Note  that,  as  leaded  components  have  been  inserted   (their  leads now  stick out of the  bottom  of the board)  adhesive  cannot  be   applied  to  the  bottom  of  the  board  by  screen-printing  - -   pin  transfer  or   dispensing  nozzle  methods  must  be  instead  used (see end  of  chapter).   Following  a second  inversion,  the board  is wave soldered.   Second  variant  simply  places  surface  mounted  components  before   Figure 2.23  Surface  mounted   insertion  of  leaded  components  (Figure 2.26).   components  on both sides  \\n\\nApplication of solder paste A = ly ——— a See .

There are problems here,   in that CS soldering  processes do  not always suit complex  surface mount   components.   Third  variant,  however,  completely  separates soldering of each type of   component,  as shown  in  Figure 2.27.  Surface mounted  components  are   initially SC soldered,  then  leaded components  are CS soldered.   Although marginally longer production times are required in this variant,   it does give the advantage that complex surface mounted components,  such   as leaded and  unleaded  chip  carriers, or TAB  integrated  circuits,  may  be   placed  on a mixed  assembly. None of the previous  methods allows this.   Fourth variant is a slightly unusual one, as it entails SC soldering of leaded   components,  using  solder  paste applied  prior  to  placement  of  surface   mounted  components  and  insertion  of  leaded  components.  This  is  not  a   common variant, although it has significant potential; and there is a natural   reason why through-hole SC (THSC) processes may become more popular   m  simply because use of surface mounted components is increasing, while   that of leaded components  is decreasing.   Situations  naturally  exist  where  all  but  a  handful  of  components  are   surface mounted.  Manufacturers  face a choice whether to  use one of the   three  previous  methods  - -   which  all  use  CS soldering  processes to  one   extent or a n o t h e r -   but this may not be acceptable by manufacturers  who   only  have SC  soldering  processes, and  wish  no  further  expenditure  on   equipmentwhich  may be used only a few times. The variant shown in Figure   2.28 has been used often for soldering of connectors and pin grid arrays, but   is now being considered for conventional  leaded  components too.   Through-hole SC soldering processes require use of modified solder paste   application processes (see end of chapter) which allow printing or dispens-   ing  of  solder  paste over  the  through-hole  pad  and  into  the  hole  itself.   Component  leads are then  inserted (usually by  hand,  although  automatic   component insertion  may be viable) carefully,  pushing solder paste further   into  the  hole.  Remnants of  solder  paste may  be  left  on  lead ends of   components.  Prior to or following  insertion of leaded components,  surface   mounted components  are placed.   Assemblies are then soldered  in any SC soldering process. Care must be   taken, though,  to  support assemblies to allow  leaded components  to  seat   freely during the process. Generally a support jig is used to hold assemblies   at their edges.   Two  points  need to  be  considered  when  SC soldering  leaded compo-   nents.  First, leaded  components  must be  able  to  withstand  SC soldering   process temperatures.  In  most CS processes, components  do  not  reach a   temperature  above 120~  but components soldered  by SC processes may   reach temperatures  upto 235~   for some time.

This is due to the limited amount of solder paste applied during printing. When viewed, fillets have a depressed appearance, but this does not significantly affect joint strength. Mixed assembly, surface mounted component on both sides. Where surface mounted components are to be placed on both sides of a mixed assembly, it is common to separate soldering of components on the top and bottom sides of the board. Procedure is illustrated in Figure 2.29. First, after the usual application of solder paste, surface mounted components are placed on the top of the board, the paste is dried, and the components are SC soldered. Next, leaded components are inserted, the board is inverted, adhesive is applied, surface mounted components are placed, and the adhesive is cured. Again, as leaded components have been inserted, adhesive applica- tion cannot be by screen-printing. After final board inversion, wave solder- ing completes the process. This method, like the previous, allows mixed assemblies to contain complex surface mounted components, such as leaded or leadless chip carriers, or TAB integrated circuits. Assembly classification Some of these assembly variations are so common that, by simple conven- tion rather than by standard, a number of classifications are in common use. These are: @ type | — application of solder paste; placement of surface mounted components; drying of solder paste, SC soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.21), illustrated in Figure 2.30 @ type li — insertion of leaded components; inversion of board; applica- tion of adhesive; placement of surface mounted components; curing of adhesive; inversion of board; CS soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.25), illustrated in Figure 2.31 @ type Ill — application of solder paste; placement of surface mounted components; drying of solder paste; SC soldering; insertion of leaded components; inversion of board; application of adhesive; placement of surface mounted components; curing of adhesive; inversion of board; CS soldering (in other words, the process previously shown in Figure 2.29) illustrated in Figure 2.32. While these are valid assembly variations, readers should note they are not the only variations.

Choice of which  of all variations we've  looked   at in this chapter (a total of eleven) should be made on an individual  basis,   and depends on available assembly equipment,  available soldering equip-   ment, available  budget,  particular components  and so on.

Soldering, however, as a general process (more commonly called soft   soldering) may be used to joint  many more things than electronic  compo-   nent  leads and  copper  tracks  of  printed  circuit  boards.  In  effect,  soft   soldering  is the basis of any process  in which  metallic  parts are jointed  by   a molten  alloy with  a melting temperature  less than 450~   Soft soldering is also an extremely old process. As noted in Chapter 1, the   Romans are known  to have used a tin/lead  alloy to joint  lead water pipes.   However,  soft soldering  using tin  and  lead  may  have but a limited  life  left   as an aside it's interesting to note that, at current production  rates of tin,   the world's  resources of the metal  will  give  less than fifty years'  more  use.   There is also a move,  currently, to create legislation against the use of lead   in  solder.   Metallurgical  properties  of tin/lead  alloys   One  of the  most  useful  properties  of  tin/lead  alloys  as soft  solders  is the   associated  range  of  low  melting  temperatures.  Table  3.1  lists melting   temperatures of a selection  of alloys,  with  proportions of the alloys shown   as percentages.  Note  that over a central  range of alloy proportions there is   no particular  melting-point,  merely a range over which the alloy  is neither   molten nor s o l i d -   a pasty or plastic state. However, at one particular alloy   proportion  (62%  tin/38%  lead)  the  alloy  melts  at  a  single  temperature   (183~  m  also the lowest melting temperature of any tin/lead alloy.  Figure   3.1  illustrates  this,  in  what  is  known  as  a  phase diagram, where  liquid,   plastic and solid states of tin/lead alloys are shown, together with the lowest   melting temperature.   A 62% tin/38%  lead alloy composition  is known  as a eutectic composi-   tion,  and  the  183~  melting-point  of this  alloy  is the  eutectic  point.  All   electronics  assembly  processes,  with  few  exceptions,  use  solder  with   constituents around the eutectic proportions,  due simply to the guaranteed   low  melting-point.  \\n\\n52  SOLDER   Table  3.1  Melting  temperatures  of tin/lead  alloys   Alloy as percentages of tin   Melting temperature  (~   and lead   i   I   100 lead   327   300   5 tin/95 lead   267   10 tin/90 lead   281   30 tin/70 lead   182 to 235   40 tin/60 lead   183 to 212   50 tin/50 lead   60 tin/40 lead   183 to  189   62 tin/38 lead   183   70 tin/30 lead   183 to  191   90 tin/10 lead   183 to 213   100 tin   232   Purely  of  interest,  there  appears  to  be  some  confusion  over  the  exact   eutectic proportions and melting-point  of solders.  Most authors refer to the   eutectic  composition  as  63%  tin/37%  lead,  but  more  recent  studies  and   authors  [Leonida,  #3]  [Klein Wassink,  #4]  have noted a eutectic  Composi-   tion  of 61.9% tin/38.1%,  which  sounds altogether more impressive,  in the   Figure 3.1  Phase diagram of tin/   lead alloys  \", '52 SOLDER', \"Alloy as percentages of tin\\n\\nMelting temperature (~\\n\\nand lead\\n\\nI\\n\\nEutectic point (62% tin/38% lead, melting-point 183°C) 1090 3070 50/50 70/30 90/30 100% lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy of tin/lead, expressed in proportions\\n\\nFigure 3.1 Phase diagram of tin/\\n\\nlead alloys\\n\\nMETALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOY  53   Photo 3.1  Three t3'pes of solder:   lead rich (left), eutectic (centre)   and tin rich (right) (Alpha Metals)   absence of first-hand proof (which we are sure most, if not all, other authors   are similarly  without)  we shall  comply  with  the  more  up-to-date findings.   For practical  purposes, at least, there is little difference,  anyway, and many   engineers  within  the  industry  consider  the  63%  tin/37%  lead  alloy  to  be   eutectic.Typicai  tolerances  of +  a few  per cent exist anyway,  in  solder as   delivered  from  suppliers.   Tin is an expensive metal, and so a reduction in the amount used in solder   makes a cheaper solder,  so a 60% tin/40%  lead  solder alloy  is sometimes   used in electronics assembly.  It exhibits a melting temperature range of 6~   rather than a defined  melting-point,  so this means a corresponding slightly   higher process temperature is required; but this generally does not affect the   soldering process significantly. Apart from precision soldering requirements   of, say, multi-layer  printed circuit  boards and surface mounting of compo-   nents,  the cheaper  60% tin/40%  lead alloy  is often  acceptable.   Most  commonly,  however,  eutectic  solder  is  used, simply  because  its   lower soldering temperature gives a lower likei ihood of component damage   in  CS  soldering  process  machines.   as  well  as  lower  dross formation   Maintaining  solder at eutectic  proportions  in, say, a CS soldering  machine   is a task which  must be carefully  attended too.  With  time,  d r o s s -   in the   is  produced  and  so  tin  generally  depletes  from  the   form  of  tin  o x i d e -    solder,  leaving an alloy  rich  in  lead.   Strength and stress resistance   Once made, the soldered joint must be strong and resist reasonable stresses.   Figure 3.2 shows graphs of how tensile strength and shear strength of solder   vary with tin/lead alloy proportions. Although  not quite at the peak of either   graph,  eutectic  tin/lead  solder still  affords  reasonable strength  for joints.  \", \"METALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOY 53\\n\\n54 SOLDER Figure 3.2 Tensile and shear strength variation of solder with tinflead alloy proportion Tensile 10/90 30/70 50/50 70/30 90/10 100% lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy proportions of tin/lead, expressed in percentages Elasticity Due to the fact that tin/lead solders exhibit significant creep, elasticity of solder is difficult to ascertain, but its modulus lies acound 30,000 Nmm?, Creep Creep is a plastic deformation which occurs when a material is subjected to stress for a period. The closer the material is to its melting temperature the more likely it is for creep to occur. It is thus of significance even at ambient temperatures for tin/lead solder, because an ambient temperature of, say 25°C (298 XK) is not too far from the melting-point of 183°C (461 K). Creep follows three distinct stages, illustrated in Figure 3.3: @ primary creep; occurring rapidly when stress is first applied, but decreas- ing with time @ secondary creep; occurring at a constant rate for the greater part of the joint’s lifetime @ tertiary creep; occurring after the joint has been subjected to sufficient secondary creep to cause its final demise. Tertiary creep occurs at an increasing rate, and ends with the joint’s rupture. This property is therefore a disadvantage in any choice of solder for electronic printed circuit board assemblies, but given that other solders will\\n\\n54 SOLDER\\n\\n100%\\n\\nTensile 10/90 30/70 50/50 70/30 90/10 lead 20/80 40/60 60/40 80/20 100% tin Alloy proportions of tin/lead, expressed in percentages\\n\\nFigure 3.3  Showing the three   stages of metallurgical creep   require a significantly higher soldering temperature which  may damage the   components  being soldered,  eutectic tin/lead  solder  is still  preferable-  a   case of advantages outweighing  a disadvantage.   Surface tension   Generally speaking, the lower the surface tension of a fluid, the easier it will   wet a surface to which  it  is applied.  Put the other way  round,  it's a fluid's   surface tension  which  holds  it together  if the surface  isn't easily wettable.   Surface tension is the force which holds insects on the surface of pond water.   It's also the reason why water can only form  into globules on a greasy plate   a detergent wash  reduces  surface  tension  so water  wets  the  plate  and   flows  out  into a thin  layer.   in effect,  surface tension  of any  liquid  acts to  minimize  its surface area.   In absence of other forces surface tension would therefore,  quite naturally,   hold  the  liquid  into  the  three-dimensional  shape  which  has the  smallest   surface  a r e a -   a sphere.  However,  forces  such  as those between  surfaces   or gravity tends to distort the  liquid's  shape somewhat.   Molten lead has a much lower surface tension than molten tin, so it might   be assumed that a higher content of lead than a eutectic solder is appropri-   ate.  However,  lead  itself  exhibits  a  significant  interfaciai  tension  with   copper which  prevents wetting,  so eutectic tin/lead solder remains the best   option.  \", 'METALLURGICAL PROPERTIES OF TIN/LEAD ALLOYS 55\\n\\n4 Rupumre Tertiary creep a Elongation _Primary creep Secondary creep / z y — Time\\n\\nFigure 3.3 Showing the three\\n\\n56 SOLDER Resistivity Eutectic tin/lead solder has an electrical resistivity some ten times that of pure copper, but it is still only around 0.17 1Qm\" at ambient temperatures, and given the much larger area of a soldered joint compared with a copper printed circuit conductor the difference is not really a significant problem at all. Thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity of tin/lead solder is about 50 Jm™s\\'K* at ambient temperatures; some one eighth of copper’s. If significant lengths of solder were used on a printed circuit board to make connections this could pose some problems, but the short distances filled by solder within soldered joints generally cause few problems here. The soldered joint Before a solder joint can be made it is imperative solder can wet the basic metals that will form the joint. This is the key to successful soldering. There are two aspects to wetting. First, itis solder’s surface tension which defines how well solder wets a metal. Consequently we should aim to use solder with as low a surface tension as possible. Second, on the other hand, cleanliness of the surface to be soldered is also of paramount importance. If not clean, solder will not wet, however low its surface tension. To illustrate these aspects Figure 3.4 looks at application of solder to a copper surface. There are three important parts to this application: @ a liquid — solder, heated beyond melting point @ a solid — copper, heated to the same temperature @ a gas — the surrounding atmosphere. At one point alone all three parts meet. An angle formed between the liquid and solid, passing through this point, is technically called the dihedral angle (though more usually known as the wetting angle or sometimes the contact angle) and is given the symbol @ (lower case Greek letter theta). This wetting angle is a direct indication of how much the surface of the metal has been wetted by the solder. Figure 3.5 shows four theoretical examples of various degrees of wetting. Figure 3.5a shows a situation where wetting has not occurred at all. Put another way, the surface of the metal is said to be completely non-wetted. Wetting angle 6 here is equal to 180°. Although we\\'ve noted earlier that', '56 SOLDER\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 57\\n\\nFigure 3.4 Application of molten solder to a copper surface THE SOLDERED JOINT 57 Dihedral angle surface tension tends to hold a liquid in a spherical shape if no other forces are apparent, Figure 3.5a illustrates how gravity affects solder globule shape. In Figure 3.5b partial wetting is said to have taken place, where wetting angle is between 0° and 180°. A different wetting condition known as dewetting is shown in Figure 3.5c. Dewetting occurs when solder initially wets a metal surface then withdraws before solidifying as temperature falls below melting point. Really the only difference between dewetting and partial wetting is evidence of wetting has occurred prior to withdrawal. There is, however, no bonding between solder and metal surface. Finally, Figure 3.5d shows the case where total wetting has occurred. Here wetting angle is 0°. Obviously, solder processes should aim for a wetting angle of 0° although, in practice, this ideal is never reached. Instead a good practical wetting angle which gives good wetting is typically taken to be less than about 75° [Manko, #5]. If surface tension of solder is sufficiently low, wetting angle can be reduced to a minimum. Often this is simply a task of maintaining solder quality by eliminating or defining tevels of impurities. Impurities There are three categories of impurities which may occur in the tin/lead solder alloy: @ those impossible to remove from base tin and lead metals in the refinement processes\\n\\nDihedral angle\\n\\nFigure 3.4 Application of molten\\n\\nIn Figure 3.5b partial wetting is said to have taken place, where wetting\\n\\nImpurities', '58 SOLDER\\n\\n58 SOLDER Photo 3.2. Good wetting on copper, showing solder with a small wetting angle and an intermetallic compound layer (Alpha Metals) ® those added by solder manufacturers or users, to improve solder’s performance @ those entering solder during the normal! course of use. Generally speaking, those in the first category aren’t significant and don’t usually affect solder performance. \\\\mpurities specifically added to solder with the aim of improving solder performance include small quantities of antimony and copper, which can reduce solder creep. Table 3.2 lists a selection of tin/lead soft solder alloys. Associated temperatures and approxi- mate proportions of tin, lead and antimony are shown. Antimony also can be used to allow a reduction in the amount of tin tequired in the solder —~ tin is an expensive metal and so the lower the percentage of tin in solder, the cheaper the solder! An alloy of 52% tin/45% lead/3% antimony, for example, exhibits a slightly raised melting tempera- ture andis, in fact, stronger compared with eutectic or near-eutectic tivlead solder. Impurities entering solder during use, however, are generally most difficult to control and can certainly give the greatest problems regarding solder joint quality. This is really of concern only to mass CS soldering processes, where a bulk of solder is maintained at a molten temperature. Here impurities are really contaminants and are not specifically desired for acceptable operation. Contaminants can arise from anything which comes into contact with the solder. Items falling accidentally into the solder — tools, nuts, bolts and so on — are a possible cause, but in most cases contamination comes from the assemblies actually being soldered in the process. This is simply because various metals on each assembly all dissolve to a small extent in the solder. Obviously amounts concerned are minute, but in large volume production systems with consequent large numbers of assemblies each minute amount builds up to eventually affect soldering action to one degree or another. This might be reflected in solder joint quality.\\n\\n@\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT  59   Figure 3.5  Four extremes of   soldered joints (a) non-wetting (b)   partial wetting (c) de-wetting (d)   total wetting   (above) non-wetting (Alpha Metals)   Photo 3.3   Photo 3.4   (right) de-wetting (Alpha Metals)  \\n\\nSolder wr Metal', \"60  SOLDER   Whether contaminants reach a level sufficient to cause process problems   depends on their rate of addition  and the amount of solder removed  in the   soldering process.  It is illustrated in a simple graph of contaminant level and   time  (Figure  3.6).  If  considerable  amounts  of  solder  are  removed  in  the   soldering process, equally considerable amoLmts of solder must be replaced   to maintain  correct solder volume.  Each addition  of fresh solder lowers the   contaminant  level  as a percentage of total  volume  so causing steps in  the   graph.   As contamination  level  increases, tin's ability to dissolve more contami-   nant is reduced.  Eventually, shown by the graph, an equilibrium  is reached   after which further additions of contaminant to the solder creates no further   increase  in  contaminant  level  dissolved.  If this  equilibrium  level  is below   maximum  permitted  levels (ie, levels above which  the soldering process  is   degraded)  no action  need be taken.

Initially taking readings, say, at monthly intervals, may be a good starting point. This allows equilibrium levels to be established and identifies if and when further action has to be taken to remove contaminants. Categories of contaminants There are three main categories of contaminants: @ oxidizing metals — aluminium, cadmium, phosphor, zinc ®@ mixed crystal-forming metals — antimony, bismuth @ intermetallic phasing metals — arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, palladium. Generally these work in similar ways within each category, a factor which allows us to consider their effects on the solder they are added to. Basically, we are interested in how solder wets a copper surface, so the best way of comparing contaminants is to consider how they affect solder’s wetting ability. Wetting ability is just one aspect of solderabitity, which is discussed later, but for now we can see how contaminant categories affect solder’s wetting ability in the wetting force curves of Figure 3.7, where pure solder’s wetting ability is compared against that of contaminated solder of each of the three categories. 3 4 eet td 2 resh solder ———__ Bol AVS E | 4 Cc é| | “a ! { ~ Time Qe\\n\\n3 4 eet td 2 resh solder Bol E | 4 Cc é| | “a !\\n\\n{ Time Qe\\n\\n62 SOLDER Figure 3.7 Wetting force curves of solders with various contami- nants In simple terms, the lower the curve, the lower is that solder’s wetting ability. So, contaminants which oxidize readily decrease solder’s ability to wet. On the other hand, contaminants which are metals which form mixed crystals actually improve solder’s ability to wet slightly. Practically, contaminants have established and typical effects, Some common contaminants and their effects are: @ aluminium — gritty joints; increase in dross* on the solder surface; solder joint appears dull. Antimony eliminates these effects @ antimony — in amounts over about 0.5% can reduce solder’s ability to wet; in smaller amounts improves tow temperature capability of solder joint @ cadmium — reduces solder’s wetting ability substantially; causes solder joints to look very dull, but in minute quantities reduces bridging between components @ copper — gritty looking joints; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ gold — frosty looking joints; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ iron — produces excessive levels of dross which can cause bridging; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ nickel —in small concentrations causes tiny bubbles or blisters on solder joint surface; but there is no recorded deleterious effect on wetting ability @ silver — can cause dull joints; in high concentration makes solder tess mobile. Silver is not generally classed as a bad contaminant and is deliberately added to some solder alloys @ zinc — causes dross rate to increase; joints look frosty. *Oross is the oxide formed on the molten solder surface in the solder bath. Rate of dross generation depends on several variables, including; contarmni- nants, temperature and agitation.

Problem  is that copper very easily oxidizes, forming   a thin  layer of  copper  oxide  on  its  surface  very  rapidly  in  air  at ambient   temperatures (at soldering temperatures oxidation  is even more rapid). This   oxide layer effectively forms a barrier preventing solder wetting the surface.   In general,  flux  is used to prepare the copper surface, removing this oxide   layer and maintaining a pure copper surface for solder to wet. It's important   to  note though,  flux  is not a prerequisite for good soldering - -   just a clean   copper surface! Chapter 5 deals with fluxes together with  preparation  and   maintenance  of metal  surfaces.   Intermetailic compound formation   If two strips of copper are soldered together as in Figure 3.8,  magnification   of the  area immediately  surrounding  the joint  by  about 200  times  shows   presence  of  a compound  material  between  the  solder  and  each  layer of   copper's  surface. This compound  material  was  not there  before  soldering   took place and is caused by combination  of tin in the solder with the surface   layer of copper to produce a new compound.  The compound  is a peculiar   type  of  compound  called  an  intermetallic compound. It  has a chemical   formula of one of two types: Cu3Sn or Cu6Sns. Formation of an intermetallic   compound  is always seen when solder wets copper and, in turn, is evidence   that wetting has occurred,  in other words, without intermetallic compound   formation,  soldering  cannot take place.  \\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 63\\n\\n64  SOLDER   Figure 3.8  Magnification  of a   solder joint between two copper   strips shows an intermetallic   compound layer   Intermetallic  compounds  are  molecular  combinations  of  atoms  of  the   metals concerned and so once an intermetallic compound  between tin and   copper exists on the surface of copper it cannot be removed by desoldering   techniques.  This  is  so  because  intermetallic  compounds  are  compounds   with strictly defined stoichiometric  ratios of elements whose atoms have an   extremely  high  affinity  for each other. This affinity  is high  enough to deny   bonding  of  other  elements.  Thus  there  is  a  strict  metallurgic  difference   Photo 3.6  Solder~copper inter-   face,  showing  the copper~tin   intermetallic compound layer as a   line separating  the two (Alpha   Metals)  \", \"64 SOLDER\\n\\nSolder | Copper strip\\n\\nIntermetallic compounc\\n\\nCopper strip Magnification Solder\\n\\nTHE SOLDERED JOINT 65\\n\\nPhoto 3.7  CS process  solder on a   printed  circuit board track (Alpha   Metals)   between alloys (such as solder - -   tin and  lead) whose element proportions   are variable, and intermetallic  compounds whose element proportions are   fixed  by chemical  formulae.   Factors affecting intermetallic compound formation   Thickness  of the intermetallic  compound  in a soldered joint  is determined   by  temperature  of  the  joint  as  it  is  soldered  and  time  spent  at  that   temperature.  Formation  of  a  tin/copper  intermetallic  compound  occurs   even  at room  temperature,  but the  reaction  is so slow  it  is of no practical   importance to solder joints.   On the other hand, where bare printed circuit boards are coated with very   thin  solder  layers such  as  those  used to  protect  boards  (see later),  it's   important  to  remember  tin  slowly  combines  with  copper  and  so leaves a   lead-rich external  layer. This affects solderability after long storage periods.   lntermetallic  compounds  of tin and copper are harder than either solder   or copper.  They  are also  more  brittle.  If an  intermetallic  compound  layer   becomes  too  thick  a possibility  of  damage  under  thermal  or  mechanical   stress exists, where solder within the joint cracks. This is illustrated in Figure   3.9.   It is not possible to make a good soldered joint unless temperatures  of all   metal surfaces are above solder's melting-point temperature.  Heat to do this   depends on the soldering process used. CS soldering processes typically use   a combination of pre-heating mechanisms together with temperature of the   solder  itself. SC processes use a variety of heating  mechanisms.   In a CS wave soldering process the solder wave is the main supply of heat;   but this only contacts the bottom of the printed circuit board. Consequently,   if a joint's thermal  path from  board  bottom  to board top  is incomplete  it is   not  possible  to  heat  it  up  in  the  small  time  a board  is  in  contact with  the   solder.  \", \"66 SOLDER\\n\\nFigure 3.9   If thick intermetallic   layers exist between  either com-   ponent  lead and solder (left) or   copper track and solder (right),   solder may crack   Figure 3.10a, b and c show stages in the solder process by which a plated   through-hole joint is soldered.  Under ideal conditions-  and with the help   of flux - -   solder first wets the lower surface of the hole (Figure 3.10a), then   begins to wick  up the  hole due to capillary  action  (Figure 3.10b).   As this takes place the solder acts as a liquid piston, forcing the flux  in the   hole  to  rise ahead  of  it.  This  prepares  the track  surface for wetting  by the   following  solder.  Finally,  as the entire hole approaches soldering tempera-   ture, the solder flows out of the top of the hole, wetting the top surface to form   a solder fillet  (Figure 3.10c).   In contrast  Figure 3.1 1 shows a condition  where  cracks  in  the  knees of   hole plating prevent heat flow  through  the joint.  In this case, a correct top   solder fillet  is not formed.   Solderability   One  of  the  most  important  terms  in  theoretical  study  of  soldering  is   solderability--  a measure of a part's ability to be soldered.  In other words,   solderability  gives  us an  idea  how wettable  a part  is, by solder.   Now  solderability  is  a  metallurgical  function  of  a  metal  surface  and,   fortunately,  it is not really necessary these days to study it in any great depth.   Components and printed circuit boards are generally assembled from  parts   of known  and guaranteed solderability so, as far as the soldering process  in  \\n\\nCopper track \\\\ \\\\ A | 4 2 Solder —T\\n\\nSOLDERABILITY  67   Figure 3.10  Stages  in a  CS soldering process,  where  (a) solder first wets the underside  of a plated through-hole (b) solder   wicks upward through  the hole, pushing flux ahead of it (c) solder flows  out of the top of the hole,  to wet the top surface   Figure 3.11  Cracks in the knees   of plated through-holes  may   prevent solder flowing  out of the   top of a hole  \", \"SOLDERABILITY 67\\n\\nComponent lead Copper track SS) || 1] _ Solder wave Solder\\n\\n= = 1} __Printed circuit board L ~ | | | ~~ base material Solder wicks er fi vets | ‘ first wets lower =e upwards, into hole\\n\\nSolder flows out and forms inte top fillet\\n\\nWA Incorrect solder fillet Cracks in knees of hole plating Solder wave\\n\\n68 SOLDER\\n\\n68  SOLDER   Photo  3.8  Upper knee of a plated   through-hole,  with cracks (Alpha   Metals)   Photo  3.9  Upper knee of a plated through-hole, without cracks (Alpha Metals)   electronics  assemblies  is concerned,  solderability  is largely  irrelevant.  For   this  reason interested  readers are referred to  more  specialized texts which   cover the topic to a greater depth  [Klein Wassink,  #4]  [Manko,  #5] than our   requirements,  as well  as relevant national  and  international  standards.   In  soldering  terms,  all  we  need  to  know  here is  how  to  measure   solderability  and what the  results mean.   Measurement  of  solderability  may  be  done  in  quite  a  number  of  ways   which  depend,  basically,  on  what  component  you  are  measuring.  For   individual  component parts such as resistors, leads, semiconductors and so   on,  one  of the  most  common  methods  is the  wetting  balance  method,  in   which a fluxed component is immersed, at a defined rate, in a bath of molten   solder. After a defined dwell time  it is withdrawn  from the bath at the same   rate. Various parts of the wetting balance method are shown  in Figure 3.12,   while the five stages which  make up the procedure are illustrated  in  Figure   3.13. These stages are:  \\n\\nFigure 3.12 Main parts of a wetting balance Figure 3.13 Five stages of the wetting balance method of testing solderability Spring. - = 5 SOLDERABILITY 69 Transducer ‘Analog balance !

Such a force-time diagram is shown in Figure 3.14, marked with various points corresponding to the five stages of the procedure. We can identify solder’s wetting ability on a force-time diagram, simply because it corresponds to the rate at which force changes after wetting commences — thatis, during the third stage of the procedure. Figure 3.15 shows possible graphs representing those obtained at several degrees of wetting. Certain factors have to be accurately defined when taking and comparing measurements of solderability, otherwise results won't be accurate, Some of these factors and typical amounts are:\\n\\n70 SOLDER\", 'SOLDERABILITY 71\\n\\nSOLDERABILITY 7% @ type of solder (say, 60% tin/40% lead) @ solder temperature (say, 235°C) @ flux (say, pure resin, R or WW) @ immersion rate (say, 25 mms!) @ immersion depth (say, 5 mm) @ preparation of component used — say, steam aging for a period of four hours).

Printed circuit board solderability of conductive track and lands can’t be measured easily using the wetting balance, so other methods are typically used [Bud, 1980 #6] instead. These include: @ edge dip test — in which a bare printed circuit board is dipped into solder. After cooling and cleaning it is inspected to ensure solder results fall within defined criteria @ wetting time test — [Thwaites, #7] also called the rotary dip test, in which several small specimens of printed circuit board are successively passed through a solder bath, gradually increasing immersion time, until a perfectly wet board results. The minimum time for good wetting is indicative of solderability @ wave solder test — in which a commercial wave soldering machine is used to solder a succession of boards ina similar way to the wetting time test. Note that this can be a misleading test, so must be carefully supervized and used @ meniscometer test — in which the rise of solder meniscus on or around a printed circuit board specimen dipped in solder is measured. From the meniscus rise it is possible to calculate the wetting angle @ meniscus test — in which solder menisci of defined volume are formed on the printed circuit board. Solderability is a function of solder spread, so a simple measurement of spread is representative of it. Solderability of plated through-holes brings other test methods, including: @ timed solder rise test — in which a printed circuit board is immersed horizontally to a set depth. Time for solder to rise through plated through- holes is a direct indication of their solderability @ solder globule test — in which a printed circuit board through-hole is pressed onto a melted globule of solder. Time for solder to wick up the through-hole is a measure of solderability. Protective coatings Although the addition of protective coatings is specifically a manufacturing process, it is covered in this chapter for sake of completeness; in many cases, as we shall see soon, the protective coating is of solder form anyway and often added to printed circuit boards by conventional soldering processes. The generic term protective coating refers to any coating which is applied to the printed circuit, at any stage, with the purpose of protecting the board', '72 SOLDER\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 73\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 73 from any form of contamination (oxide, moisture and, in some cases, solder itself). Consequently, there are three main types of protective coatings: @ pre-assembly coatings —— applied to maintain solderability, therefore assuring good soldering can take place after assembly @ pre-soldering coatings — solder resists also called solder masks or solder stop-offs (or, if you want to be pedantic and grammatically correct; solder stops-off), which selectively protect parts of printed circuit boards from being soldered @ post-assembly coatings — various encapsulation methods, of which conformal coatings are the most common, which protect the assembled and soldered printed circuit board during its working life. Use of the generic term protective coating is often used specifically to imply only pre-assembly coatings. While this, in itself, is not incorrect, it’s important to remember pre-soldering and post-assembly coatings are protective coatings, too. Pre-assembly protective coatings Once component parts (usually bare printed circuit boards} of the electron- ics assembly process are known to have defined solderability, it is common to coat them with a protective substance in an attempt to maintain solderability at this level. This is only an attempt, note, as no coating can maintain solderability indefinitely. In most instances pre-assembly protective coatings are of solder form in thin layers over the copper track. This is perhaps seen as advantageous in that it’s solder which is to be applied at a later time anyway. In the remaining few cases, however, organic compound and precious metal coatings are used and it’s here that we start. Organic compounds Two types of organic compounds are used: @ monomolecular lacquers @ resin-based (see Chapter 5), giving approximate solderable lifespans of about three months (mono- molecular) and six months (resin-based). Resin-based coatings give the advantage of aiding most fluxing processes, although hinder application of low-solids fluxes (see Chapter 5). Lacquers dissolve into flux as it is applied, then are dispersed by the soldering process.', \"Pre-assembly protective coatings\\n\\nOrganic compounds\\n\\n74 SOLDER\\n\\n74 SOLDER Figure 3.16 Roller coating solder on to a printed circuit board Thickness is fairly important: too thin and susceptibility to damage or low shelf-life will result; too thick and coatings may crack or blister with the same result. A disadvantage is the fact they are hygroscopic, so absorbing water, which with time will reach the metal underneath, causing oxidation. Advantage of such coatings is their relative low cost. As long as the circuit board is to be used after only a short storage period, they can prove quite economical. Many consumer application assemblies have been manufac- tured recently using lacquered printed circuit boards, for this reason, pantcularty by Japanese companies. Metallic layers Three forms of metallic layer are used to protectively coat circuit boards: @ precious metal plating (gold, rhodium, platinum, palladium} @ silver @ tin/ead alloy coating. Precious metals are often used to protect edge-connection terminals of a circuit board. Their low oxidation rates and metallic softness help to ensure that push-on contacts maintain an adequate low resistance. Thicknesses of precious metal coatings used to protect terminals varies from about 2 um (over nickel-plated copper) to about 5 um (over bare copper). Occasionally precious metals are used to maintain solderability of complete printed circuit boards and, in this case, thickness should be between about 0.25 um and 0.5 jim. Shelf-life of precious metal coated boards is up to 12 months. A coating of pure tin, or tin/lead alloy (ie, solder itself), is the normal method of protectively coating printed circuit boards to maintain solderability. Three main methods are used to coat circuit board surface: @ ‘oller coating — using a solder-covered roller, partially immersed in a solder bath, shown in Figure 3.16.

(Hot-air knives are also found in some machine soldering processes — see Chapter 7). Using a hot-air knife to level a solder coating is commonly knownas hot- air levelling (HAL), Boards properly coated and levelled in this way should have a coating thickness from 5 um to 15 4m, and will have a shelf-life of at least 12 months.

Technically, the process of fusing is one of heating a previously electro- plated tinAead layer to ensure an interfacing alloy bond, while levelling is\", \"PROTECTIVE COATINGS 75\\n\\nBoard, dipped then removed 2 \\\\4 “Q}'O Hot-air knife\\n\\n76 SOLDER\\n\\nthe  process of  removal  of  much  of a tin/lead  layer to  leave  behind  a thin   coating.  These terms  are  often  used incorrectly,  and  are  even  sometimes   interchanged.   Where surface mounted components with fine pitched  lead spacings are   to be placed onto  printed circuit  boards,  plated  boards have an advantage   over  hot-air  levelled  boards  simply  because  the  surface  is  flatter.  Figure   3.18a shows a cross-section  of a hot-air  levelled  copper track on a printed   circuit  board,  which  is quite  convex.   As the termination  of a fine  pitched  component  is placed  onto the track   it tends to slide off the convex surface,  misplacing the component.  A plated   track,  on  the  other  hand  (Figure  3.18b),  is  relatively  flat,  so a component   termination  is less likely to slide off.   Manufacturing  processes for circuit  boards may  include  tin/lead  plating   of  the  copper  track.  In  such  cases,  it  would  appear  that  no  secondary   protective coating is required.  However, solderability of the original copper   surface, prior to tin/lead electroplating is important here. If the electroplated   layer  is  applied  to  copper  which  is  not  solderable,  on  heating  to  ensure   fusing the electroplated  layer will  become dewetted and maybe even  non-   wetted - -   the original  copper surface must have acceptable solderability to   prevent this.

In such  cases solder  resists,  sometimes  called  solder masks   or  solder  stop-offs,  can  be  used. Fairly  obviously,  a  solder  resist must   provide two functions.  First, it must be heat resistant, to prevent the heat of   the  soldering  process  from  breaking  it  down.  Second,  it  must  be  non-   wettable.   Solder  resists can  be  temporary,  in  that  they  are  removed  after  the   soldering  process, or  permanent.  In  general,  temporary  solder  resists are   used to  protect  particular  areas of a  PCB  during  mass soldering  methods   such as dip, drag, and wave soldering. They are typically used to keep small   areas such as plated through-holes, gold-plated contacts and so on, clear of   solder  for  later  purposes.  After  soldering,  they  are  removed.  Although   usually of a liquid  form,  applied  to the surface  of the  PCB, then  left to dry   before  soldering,  mechanical  resists such  as  plastic  or  wooden  plugs  or   inserts, and even adhesive tape are not unknown. Occasionally, protrusions   from  soldering  machine  conveyor  systems are  used  to  mask areas of   assemblies  from  the  soldering  process. These are only  economical,  how-   ever,  in large-volume production,  and the area to be masked must be allied   to an edge of the assembly for the protrusion  to be able to cover  it and  no   other areas.   Permanent  solder  resists are  often  used to  eliminate  the  risk  of  solder   bridges  between  closely-spaced  adjacent  tracks.  This  means  that  PCB   designers  can  reduce  gap  sizes and  have  extra  freedom  in  track  layouts.   Secondary  advantages  include:  physical  protection  of tracks,  particularly   those of a fine-line nature; reduced drainage of solder from joints which may   otherwise cause the joints  to be poorly soldered;  reduced  consumption  of   solder  overall,  coupled  with  reduced  contamination  of the  solder  in  the   bath; a known  dielectric  present between tracks (although this can change   with  ingression  of water);  improved visual  inspection of solder joints due to   the fact that resist reflects  light  less than joints;  good  appearance.   Permanent solder resists are applied  using conventional  screen-printing   techniques or, where high accuracy is important such as in the production   of  fine-line  boards,  they  are  photo-printed  following  liquid  or  dry-film   application.  Two  main  types of permanent solder resist are used:   Q  epoxy-based   @  acrylate-based.

Assemblies and components may be subjected to either a corrosive environ- ment or a mechanically stressful environment. Effects of one or both of these environments may be reduced to acceptable levels (though never elimi- nated) by encapsulating assemblies. Assembly encapsulation is a generic term referring to techniques using resin-like materials to package the assembly. There are four main methods of encapsulation: @ conformal coating @ embedding @ impregnation @ potting. Conformal coating By far the most common method of encapsulation, conformal coating, sometimes called surface coating or surface sealing, uses thin (between 0.005 mm to 0.075 mm) transparent coats of materials to provide an electrically insulating protective barrier against humidity, dirt, vaporous contaminants, and foreign bodies such as metal filings. Fully assembled printed circuit boards are often conformally coated to help protect them during normal operating conditions, where hostile environments are not envisaged. Typical coating materials include: @ acrylic @ dially! phthalate (DAP) @ epoxy @ oleo resin @ olystyrene @ paraxylylene ®@ polyimide @ polyurethane @ silicone @ silicone rubber. Of these, acrylic, diallyl phthalate, epoxy, polyimide, silicone and urethane are the most common. A summary of the main characteristics of these six conformal coating types are listed in Table 3.3, based on Concoat’s data [Concoat, 1989 #8].\\n\\nPROTECTIVE COATINGS 79\\n\\nTable  3.3  Summarized  characteristics of the  six main  conformal  coating types   Characteristic   Acrylic  Diallyl phthalate Epoxy  Polyimide Polyurethane Silicone   I l l    li   I I I    I   III   II   3   2   2   2   Abrasion resistance   1   1   2   1   3   Acid resistance   1   1   1   1   1   3   Alkali resistance   2   1   3   3   3   2   3   3   1   Application  ease   41   Cure  time   3   32   4   3   1   Humidity resistance:   2   1   1   short-term   1   1   1   2   1   2   1   3   long-term   1   2   2   2   1   Mechanical  strength   3   2   3   4   4   Pot-life   3   2   1   Removal:   - -    2   burn   1   m   3   - -    1   chemical   m   3   ~   - -    5   1   2   5   1   Solvent resistance   1   2   1   2   5   Temperature resistance   5   3   5   Notes:  characteristics are recorded in descending  scale of  1 to 5, that is,  1 is  good,  5  is poor.   1  reduced to  3 if heat-cured.   reduced to 2 if heat-cured.   2   I   When  selecting a coating,  known  use and environment of the assembly   must  be carefully  considered.  Manufacturers'  precautions  should  also be   followed,  and  safety precautions  regarding  vapours  and  toxic  materials   observed.   Conformal  coatings  also may  be applied  to  individual  components,  or   sub-assemblies,  in the case of, say, hybrid assemblies to be mounted on a   through-hole printed circuit board. In this case, the conformal  coating is to   protect the sub-assembly during  later  processes, such as soldering,  in the   assembly's  production.   Application  of conformai  coatings  is usually by brushing,  dipping,  flow   coating or spraying. Paraxylylene,  is an exception, as it is applied by vapour   phase  deposition  technique  under  vacuum.  Note  that  application  of  a   conformal  coating  by  spraying  may  cause damage to  electrostatically   sensitive  components.  \", \"Acrylic Diallyl phthalate Epoxy Polyimide Polyurethane Silicone\\n\\nI l l\\n\\nI\\n\\n80  SOLDER   It is sometimes thought that conformal  coatings aid mechanical  strength   and thermal  insulation,  providing  protection  against stresses such as vibra-   tion or thermal  shock, but this is not true, and other encapsulation  methods   must be used where such  stresses are envisaged.   Conformal  coatings do, on the other hand, allow a measure of protection   against  damp  environments,  and  where  occasional  condensation  is  met   conformally  coated  assemblies  may  function  satisfactorily.  But  where   constantly damp environments are encountered, conformal coatings are not   suitable.   Embedding   An  embedding process  completely  envelopes  an  assembly or component   within a protective material not less than 6 mm thick, filling free space in the   assembly.  A  mould  or  container  is  required  to  confine  the  encapsulating   material  while  hardening,  after which  the embedded assembly  is released   from  the mould.  The result is a self-contained  assembly module.   Usually,  mould-releasing  agents  are  used to  treat  a  mould  prior  to   embedding  an assembly,  so that once cured,  the embedded  assembly can   be easily released. Exceptions to this are where moulds are made of materials   such  as polythene  or  PTFE; these  are self-releasing.  Mould  release  agents   may  be  non-drying  liquid,  or  dry-film  forms.  Liquid  forms  may  migrate  to   areas which  require  bonding,  so  as  a  rule-of-thumb,  dry-film  forms  are   normally  preferred.   Impregnation   Impregnation methods rely on the injection of a material into all intervening   spaces  or  voids  of  components  to  provide  environmental  protection.   Impregnation  may  be  used  alone,  or  together  with  other  methods  of   encapsulation.   Pott/ng   Potting is an embedding method where the encapsulating material bonds to   the mould  or container,  becoming  integral with  the item.  Release from the   mould  is therefore  not wished  for.  \\n\\n4 Lead-free solder At the time of writing the debate on using lead-free solders is hotting up. At a recent meeting of the Soldering Science and Technology Club (SSTC — Autumn Conference, 22 October 1998), Nick Jolly of the UK's Department of Trade & Industry asked Is Lead-Free Moving from a Long Term to a Medium Term Issue? As part of the publication of the first draft of the report on Waste from Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Article 4 proposes that lead and other hazardous materials be phased out by 1 January 2004. The future timetable of the full draft is: @ 8 September 1998 — discussion of second draft by next meeting of national experts @ European Commission intends to present proposal to European Parlia- ment and Council of Ministers by end of 1998 or early 1999 @ expect directive to be become effective 18 months after adoption. What’s needed in the future? If the expected lead-free directive goes through, several aspects result directly, including: @ the level of manufacturing industry’s capability to handle implications @ the need to design for dis-assembly @ the need for material reclamation @ no lead @ a requirement for drop-in replacements for tin/lead solder @ organizations must prepare @ there needs to be an awareness campaign.\", \"82 LEAD-FREE SOLDER\\n\\nAt  the  same conference,  James H.  Vincent  of  GEC-Marconi  Materials   Technology - -   Caswell,  presented the paper  IDEALS w  Improved Design   life  and Environmental Aware  manufacture of electronics  assemblies by   Lead-free Soldering. The programme looking at lead-free will be completed   early in  1999. The consortium  includes the programme coordinator:  Mar-   coni  Electronic  Systems G M M T -   Caswell,  as  well  as  several  other   companies;  Philips Centre for Manufacturing Technology, Siemens Corpo-   rate Logisticsolders, Multicore Solders, Witmetaal-  AlphaFry Technology,   N M R C -   University College Cork.   The conclusions thus far are that no single drop-in alloy is suitable for all   applications.  Soldering temperatures are likely to be higher with  lead-free   alloys m  it is suggested that wave soldering processes will  increase by 10~   while reflow processes will  increase 20~  This raises many issues concern-   ing the higher temperature for boards,  components,  equipment,  narrower   temperature profile windows,  board and component finishes.   In summary:  lead-free soldering is a practical proposition with direct and   indirect benefits.  It's an opportunity for the industry,  however,  we  have to   remember that:   We are grateful to Tin International, a journal associated with IT[I, formerly   known as the International Tin Research Institute, for permission to publish   the following  feature article written  by  its chief  lead-free  solder  specialist   Kay  Nimmo.  The  authors  feel  this  article  neatly  sums up  the  lead-free   soldering position.  \\n\\n1\\n\\nLEAD-FREE SOLDERING m  NOW A HOT TOPIC!  83   Lead-free  soldering---  now  a hot topic!   There is a world-wide environmental  movement away from the use of lead,   towards substitute  non-toxic  products based on tin.  There are examples of   lead-free shot, ammunition,  wheel weights,  lamps,  casting alloys for toys as   well as examples of lead-free solders being used in the electronics  industry.   Nortel  was  one  of  the  first  companies  to  announce  the  production  of  a   telephone  using  lead-free  solder,  and  this  product  won  the  company  an   environment  award  in  1997 from  The Financial Post.   The Nortel  lead-free   Photo 4.1   telephone   Just one year on  has seen significant change towards  a worldwide  lead-   free electronics  industry.  While  anti-lead  legislation  was first  proposed  in   the  USA  around  10  years  ago  with,  for  example,  the  Lead  Exposure   Reduction  Act  (S.  729),  and  the  Lead Tax  Act  (H.R.  2479,  S.  1347),  the   momentum  for  lead-free  electronics  has gradually  shifted  away  from  the   USA, through  Europe,  to Japan, where  a growing  number  of major  OEMs   have announced significant voluntary  reductions  in  lead  use within  1 or 2   years.   Examples include; Hitachiwhich will  reduce its use of lead solder in 1999   by  half from  1997  levels  and  stop  using  lead  solder  by  2001;  Matsushita   (Panasonic) which  will  stop  using conventional  lead  solder  in  2001;  and   NEC which  will  reduce  lead  consumption  in  solder by 50%  by 2002.   Many  other companies  are  in  the process of preparing for the  lead-free   solder age including;  Toshiba which  is developing a solder for high-density  \", \"The Nortel lead-free\\n\\nPhoto 4.1\\n\\ntelephone\\n\\n84  LEAD-FREE SOLDER   Lead-free solder   Photo 4.2   alloys now come  in all forms   cellular phone PCBs, and Sonywhich has developed its own lead-free alloy   said to  have a reliability five times that of tin-lead.   Finally, even those companies who do not manufacture  but can specify   materials to be included  in products are involved.  NTT (Nippon Telegraph   and Telephone)is gearing  up for  'green'  material  procurement  by 2001,   when the use of lead and cadmium-free  materials safe for the environment   will  be specified.

The  main   driving  force  towards  lead-free  soldering  is therefore  through  end-of-life   electrical  and  electronic  appliance  legislation  proposed  by the  European   Commission  and Japanese government.   Recycling  legislation  was  pioneered  by  the  European  Parliament  and   Council  Directive  on  End-of-Life Vehicles  (ELVs). The draft directive  pro-   poses that producers should control the use of hazardous substances from   the  concept  stage of  new  vehicles,  in  particular,  the  use  of  lead, PVC,   mercury,  cadmium  and  hexavalent  chromium  should  be  phased out  in   vehicles put on the market after 1 January 2002 (lead in batteries is exempt).   Although circuit boards are also exempt from this draft they may be covered   by an additional  proposal  covering a much  wider  product group.

A   series of equipment types are covered  ranging from  household  appliances   (white goods) to control  instruments,  and from  medical  equipment to video   and sound equipment (brown goods), even watches, games, and automatic   dispensers are  included.  The current draft wishes to:   ensure that the use of lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and halogen-   ated flame retardants contained in electrical and electronic equipment is phased out   by 1 January 2004.   The  Japanese ministry  of  trade  (MITI)  has  drafted  a  similar  law  that  will   require consumer and business users of electrical  appliances to return end-   of-life  goods to  retailers or  local  authorities for  recycling.  The cost will  be   borne by manufacturers or importers of the product who will  be required to   arrange for dismantling  and  recycling.   It is often argued that if all electronic waste  is recycled any lead content   can be safely treated.  However,  it is an accepted fact that not all waste will   be collected  and,  particularly  with  small  units  such  as mobile  phones,  the   collection  rate will  be low,  even  if the hazardous material  content remains   high.  Collection  of small  electronic  goods and the separation  of  lead from   these  products  before  recycling  treatments  would  be  extremely  costly   compared  with  the  use of  lead-free solders.   Scandinavia  is  particularly  concerned  over  the  effects  of  lead  and  is   intend!ng to reduce  its use of the metal  whether  recycling can be achieved   or not. A meeting of the Nordic Ministers of Environment in 1994 produced   a statement  that:   in the long run the phasing out of lead is necessary to reduce risk from lead exposure   on human health and the environment.   This was signed by Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland and led   to a proposal  by the Danish  Environment Protection Agency to ban import,   sales and production  of lead and  products that contain  lead.   While this is currently in draft form, and not yet approved by the European   Commission,  it could come into force immediately, and could even be back-   dated  to take  effect  from  1 January  1998.  Lead in  both  the  chemical  and   elemental  form  is covered  and the draft  includes two  clauses  affecting the   use of solder; firstly, those used for incandescent lamps, and secondly, those   used in heating, ventilation  and sanitary equipment.  Once accepted by the   EC, it is likely that other  Nordic  countries will  introduce  similar  legislation   that may also extend to other solder products. Already Sweden is aiming that   all use of lead should eventually be phased out even  in  lead-acid  batteries   despite their well  established  recycling  network.  ', '86 LEAD-FREE SOLDER\\n\\nTHE AGE OF LEAD-FREE SOLDERING IS APPROACHING FAST 87   The age of lead-free  soldering is approaching fast   While environmental  reasons forcing a change away from the use oftin-lead   are seen by some as a negative  process, the switch  to lead-free solders can   bring  positive  advantages.  The  use  of  non-toxic  materials  improves  the   public  image  of  product  and  company  and  brings  potential  technical   advantages as well as possible overall cost savings. It can now be shown that   the switch from tin-lead to lead-free alloys is achievable  if enough informa-   tion  on the replacement alloys  is known.  A conclusion  from  a Brite-Euram   funded  pan  European project  on  lead-free  soldering  is  that  there  are  no   technical show-stoppers to the adoption of lead-free processes and, that the   route to environmentally-friendly  manufacture  and  more reliable soldered   products  seems to be open.   As  part  of  this  project  GEC  Marconi/Siemens  joint  venture  GPT  has   reported  the  successful production  trials  of  a  lead-free  solder.  GPT  has   already eliminated  lead from its circuit board finish and is currently securing   supplies  of lead-free components.  Although  the  new alloy  is slightly  more   expensive than tin-lead GPT expects to offset the cost with savings from the   lead-free  circuit  boards  making  the  total  process  change  cost  neutral.   Additionally  the  lead-free  material   is  twice  as  strong  as  tin-lead  and   therefore  has an  advantage  in  harsh conditions  such  as in  cars.   Panasonic has already released a lead-free Mini-Disc  in Japan (produced   at a rate of 40,000  units a month), that is to be available  in  Europe shortly.   A following  Mini-Disc from  Panasonic will  also use lead-free solder.  Other   products  are  also  expected  from  manufacturers  such  as  Hitachi,  with  all   Japanese OEMs selecting different  solders for each  product dependent on   the  properties  required.  So,  while  one  alloy  may  be  chosen  to  increase   reliability over tin-lead in products seeing extreme service conditions, other   alloys may be selected for a process route where lower melting temperature   is of more  importance.   Lead-free  solders  can  be  found  with  a  variety  of  properties.  When   selecting  which  to  use  the  easiest place  to  start  is  to  consider  melting   temperature ranges. Low temperature alloys such as the tin-bismuth  eutec-   tic  (138~  have  been  in  use in specialist applications  for  many years and   higher temperature alloys, such as the tin-silver eutectic (221 ~   have also   been used in high  reliability  products.  New alloys have been developed to   provide  further  lead-free  options;  the  tin-silver-copper  eutectic  (217~   melts  at  a  slightly  lower  temperature  than  tin-silver  and  can  give  better   solderability  in certain  applications,  a tin-bismuth-zinc  alloy (189-199~   is the  closest  in  temperature  to tin-lead  but  difficult  to  use, while  the tin-   copper eutectic  (227~   is a cheaper,  but  higher temperature option.   It is important to select the correct lead-free alloy for the job n  ask advice   from your supplier or ITRI m  and your lead-free soldering will  be a success.

However,  recent  exciting   advances  in  soldering  machines  have  identified  a  particular  ideal  case   (some controlled  atmosphere ~  usually  nitrogen ~  environments)  where   fluxes  may no  longer  be required  under certain  conditions.  Much  work  is   continuing  in soldering techniques  with  nitrogen  atmospheres.   We  have  already  touched  on  the  prospect  in  Chapter  3,  where  we   considered  preparation  of the metal  surface to be soldered  and stated that   the only prerequisite to successful soldering  is a clean metal surface. We'll   expand on that now and stress that clean means truly clean ie, without oxide   or contamination  of any  kind,  with  an external  surface of pure  metal  and   nothing else. Naturally,  as long as the metal  surface can be maintained  to   this  level  of  cleanliness  as solder  is  applied,  solder  wets  it.  Results from   controlled  environment  processes are so encouraging  it seems likely  they   will  play a major r61e in electronics assembly soldering over the remainder   of  the  decade  and  beyond,  probably  becoming  the  norm  in  large  scale   production  of electronics  assemblies within  just a few years.   In most other soldering  processes, of course (with the only other excep-   tion being ultrasonic soldering),  flux is still a fundamental  requirement; and   will  be so for a while.  Consequently,  much of this chapter discusses flux:  its   importance,  its  function,  and  its  variants,  as  a  vital  part  of  soldering   processes. We  do,  however,  include  a resum~ of no-residue or  low-solids   fluxes;  which,  in reality, perform exactly the same r61e as conventional  flux   as a cleaning agent in controlled environments.  No-residue or low-solids   fluxes  will  become  inevitably  more  and  more  important  as  controlled   environment processes become popular. Their popularity will  probably be   forced  on  the  industry,  as  the  current  drive  towards  elimination  of   chiorofluorocarbons  builds  up speed.  \", '90 FLUX\\n\\n90 FLUX Figure 5.1 Three layers of a copper track Need for flux Fluxes are used in the first place to clean the metal surface to be soldered, then cover it to prevent further formation of contaminants, Contaminants are anything which form a barrier between the pure metal and solder. Obviously the contaminant does not have to be an externally applied material. Commonest contaminant is simply the oxide formed by the metal on its own surface — almost al! metals oxidize immediately on exposure to oxygen in the ambient air and this oxide alone is sufficient to prevent solder wetting the metal surface. To illustrate extent of the problems in cleaning metals ready for soldering, Figure 5.1 shows a section of copper track of an assembly (obviously, not to scale) which shows three distinct layers of material. Most internal is the metal part to be soldered ie, pure metal copper. Next layer is a reaction layer, of strongly bound and so very adherent materials such as oxide, sulphide and carbonate, as well as residues from previous production steps. Finally, and most externally, an absorption layer exists, in which materials such as water, gases and residues from preceding reactions collect. From outside in, therefore, flux must: @ dissolve materials of the absorption layer @ remove oxides, sulphides and carbonates and any other residues @ dissolve some substrate molecules, to initiate formation of intermetallic compounds when solder is applied. Obviously this is a simplification of the job of flux, but it does highlight the process: by cleaning the metal surface then covering it, fluxes keep the surface at a stage of readiness for the solder to flow and wet the metal. On the other hand, besides this vital cleaning and covering function, fluxes must have several secondary characteristics: Absorption layer Reaction layer Pure copper\\n\\nAbsorption layer Reaction layer Pure copper\\n\\nFigure 5.1\\n\\nThree layers of a\\n\\ncopper track\\n\\nHOW FLUXES WORK 91\\n\\nHOW FLUXES WORK 91 Figure 5.2 Four stages in solder wetting a copper surface {a) solid Solder (b) starting to melt (c) starting to flow (d) wetting the copper @ they must be able to withstand the soldering temperature @ they must break down oxide layers formed on the surface of molten solder — this allows solder to flow and wet @ ideally they should not attack and corrode either the metal of the joint or the surrounding materials @ they and their residues after the soldering process should be easily removable. While ail flux systems perform the prime function, these secondary charac- teristics are variable and fluxes perform with significant differences simply because of minor characteristic variations. How fluxes work Figure 5.2 shows a copper sheet, covered with a layer of flux and placed on a heating plate to raise the temperature of the sheet above solder’s melting- point. A ball of solid solder is placed on the sheet (Figure 5.2a) and the heating plate is turned on. As the temperature of the copper rises above solder’s melting-point the solder begins to melt (Figure 5.2b), starts to flow (Figure 5.2c) then wets the copper sheet (Figure 5.2d). Note the resultant small wetting angle and feathered edge of the solder, which indicate good wetting. A close-up view of this action is shown in Figure 5.3, at the point where solder is melting and flowing (equivalent to the situation in Figure 5.2c). Here you can see the copper sheet, a thin layer of copper oxide, flux, solder and solder oxides. In the illustrated process two things are important. First, as the copper sheet heats, it melts the flux which then becomes chemically active. As it does so it dissolves the oxides from the copper surface and the solder surface and prevents any further oxidization.

As the solder flows it pushes the flux (and its resultant   fluxing action) ahead of it. As the fluxing action moves forward,  so does the   solder to wet  more copper.   Effectiveness  of  a  flux  in  removing  oxide  and  contaminants  from  the   surface  of  metals  is  known  as  its  activity.  Fluxes vary  in  their  chemical   activity.  Type  of  flux  used generally  depends  on  the  oxide  layers  of  the   surfaces to be soldered. If only a thin oxide  layer is present,  a flux with only   a low activity  is required.  On the other hand,  surfaces with  a considerable   oxide  layer require  more  highly  active  fluxes.   Anyone  would  be  forgiven  for  thinking  the  best  solution  to  solder  all   surfaces  is to  use only  highly  active  fluxes.  This  way,  whatever  the  metal   surface and however thick  its oxide  layer, soldering is guaranteed. There is   a price  to  be  paid,  however,  when  highly  active  fluxes  are  used  m   flux   activity  is closely allied  with  the corrosivity  of the residues  remaining after   soldering  has  taken  place.  A  highly  active  flux  often  leaves corrosive   residues  which  may  corrode  the  solder  itself.  Effective  post-soldering   cleaning without  delay,  usually with  water,  is essential.   Categorization  of fluxes   Numbers of different types of flux are hard to evaluate (some 46 different low   solids fluxes alone, from  12 manufacturers worldwide  have been recorded   [Rubin, 1990 #9]), so it's easy to see there must be hundreds if not thousands   of  available  types.  Consequently,  to  say  the  very  least,  it  is  difficult  to   correlate  all  types.  What's  more,  fluxes  have  been  used in  one  form  or   another  for  a  long  t i m e -   since  soldering  first  began.  Quite  naturally,   therefore,  many  different categorization  methods  have been  used through  \", \"92 FLUX\\n\\nFlux Copper ~ oxide a Copper\\n\\nSolder can wet cleaned copper Fluxing action\\n\\nCATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 93\\n\\ntime,  depending on what the latest new flux product offered better than the   rest.   We start by defining some of the many important categorization  methods   currently used. First is simply whether they are based on naturally occurring   or  synthetic  materials.  First flux  ever  used in  electronics  was,  in  fact,  a   natural  material-  gum rosin,  also commonly  called  colophony,  which  is   made from  pine tree sap, a resin. This sap, after distillation,  produces solid   rosin  which  is dissolved  in  an organic  solvent such  as alcohol  to produce   flux.  Most  synthetic  fluxes  are  based  on  organic  acids,  although  other   materials  are used.   Another way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues  remaining from   the flux  after the soldering  process.  Thus,  these are  known  as organically   soluble  fluxes,  or  water  soluble  fluxes.  It's important  to  note  with  this   categorization,  however, that the term soluble refers purely to the residues   left  after  soldering,  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  flux  itself  is   soluble  in  organic  solvents  or  water.  Further,  organically  soluble  flux   residues  can often  be removed just with  water and detergent,  while  many   water soluble fluxes can be removed with  some solvents.  So this categori-   zation of fluxes is not particularly  logical,  although  is still  useful bearing its   limitations  in  mind.   Another  categorization  of  fluxes:  non-activated  fluxes  or  activated   fluxes,  refers to whether  chemicals  have been  added  to  increase  activity.   Generally,  a pure  rosin  flux  is  said  to  be  non-activated,  while  any  other   rosin-based flux  is said to be activated.  With  this method of categorization   it's  particularly  easy to  further  categorize  activated  fluxes  into  grades of   activity,  such as:   L  =   low,  or no flux  or flux  residue activity   M  =  moderate flux  or flux  residue activity   H  =  high flux  or flux  residue activity.   These categories  can  be sub-divided,  say, 0 and  1, to  indicate  absence or   presence of halide  in  a flux.   Yet another categorization  of fluxes groups them  according to composi-   tion.  As  each  compositional  type  of  flux  has  its  own  unique  properties   regarding activity and residue solubility anyway, this method of categoriza-   tion  is perhaps one of the most useful,  particularly as it is commonly  used.   Often abbreviations may be used following this categorization  method; the   abbreviations  deriving  from  various  specifications  and  standards,  and   usually referring to the type of activator added. Table 4.1  lists common flux   abbreviations,  abbreviation  meanings,  subsequent types of flux and activi-   ties  according to this categorization  method.  However,  this  method  gives   little  information  regarding what  activators  or solvents  are  used.  \\n\\nAnother way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues remaining from\", '94 FLUX Table 5.1 Common flux abbreviations, meanings, flux types, and levels of activity Abbreviation Meaning Flux type Level of activity R Rosin Purest grade of rosin, no activator added Very low Ww Water white Purest grade of rosin Very low RMA Mildly activated rosin Rosin, with addition of mild activators Mildly active OA Organic acid Organic acid activator Strongly active RA Activated rosin Rosin, with addition of strong activators Strongly active SA Synthetic activated Rosin, with synthetic activators Strongly active SRA Superactivated rosin _ Rosin, with very strong activators Very strongly active Such a hotch-potch of categorization methods and such a wide variety of fluxes inevitably leads to much confusion and ambiguity when users attempt to choose a flux fora given purpose. Acknowledging this, the International Standards Organization has attempted to clarify the situation, distinguishing fluxes according to four variables: @ flux type — whether resin, organic, or inorganic form @ flux basis — what the flux is based on @ flux activation — what type of activator, if any, is included @ flux form — whether liquid, solid, or paste These are summarized in Figure 5.4 and given a number or letter for each variable. Thus, an organic flux, based on phosphoric acid, in paste form, has a Classification as type 321C. Resin fluxes These are often, historically, based on the use of gum rosin obtained from Pine tree sap although many synthetic materials are now used, too. To clear up a potentially confusing point: it’s sometimes common to hear the terms resin and rosin interchanged. Rosin is, in fact, by dictionary definition the solid residue obtained from the distillation of oil of turpentine from crude turpentine — this, by chance alone, happens to include the residue distilled from pine tree sap and used in solder fluxes; what we, ambiguously, know as rosin. On the other hand, resin is an adhesive, inflammable substance secreted by most plants and exuding naturally from fir and pine — that is, sap. Resin can also be made synthetically. So, rosin is distilled from a resin — but that doesn’t mean resin is rosin, or indeed that all resins are made into the rosin used in soldering flux. On the other hand, a resin flux may be based on synthetic resin or natural rosin.', '94 FLUX', 'Very strongly active\\n\\n@\\n\\n   n  o  i  t  a  z  i  r  o  g  e  t  a  c     x  u  l   f  n  o  i  t  a  z  i  n  a  g  r  O     s  d  r  a  d  n  a  t  S     l  a  n  o  i  t  a  n  r  e  t  n  I     4  .  5     e  r  u  g  i  F \\n\\n   n  o  i  t  a  z  i  r  o  g  e  t  a  c     x  u  l   f  n  o  i  t  a  z  i  n  a  g \\n\\nO     s  d  r  a  d  n  a  t  S     l  a  n  o  i  t  a  n  r \\n\\nn\\n\\nr\\n\\ne\\n\\nt\\n\\nn\\n\\nI\\n\\n4\\n\\n.\\n\\n5\\n\\ne\\n\\nr\\n\\nu\\n\\ng\\n\\ni\\n\\nF\\n\\n96 FLUX Where resin is used as a flux, itis dissolved in some organic solvent. Resin flux residues, also, can be removed by dissolution with organic solvent (a fact which makes rosin-based flux the original organically soluble flux). Indeed, rosin has two excellent properties which makes its use as an electronics solder flux preferable to many others. First, as a liquid at soldering temperature it is active, being a mild organic acid, and so provides good wetting capabilities for solder on lightly tarnished metal such as copper and gold. Second, as a residue in solid form, after the soldering process and consequent evaporation of organic solvent, it is basically non- reactive, so does not corrode the completed joint, and is a good insulator. Rosin has excellent flux properties. When heated on an oxidized copper surface it becomes active and attacks the copper oxide. Its active material is abiatic acid which converts copper oxide to a blue copper abiate. This leaves a bright metallic copper surface. As rosin cools it forms a glossy hard layer which is totally inert and protects the copper surface from further oxidation. In all these respects it is, therefore, a perfect flux; it cleans and covers lightly tarnished metal surfaces satisfactorily and there is no specific need to remove its residues from the printed circuit board, unless later manufac- turing processes such as conformal coating require it. Unfortunately, however, basic rosin flux has quite a low activity so is only useful for removing very thin oxides from metals. Fluxes based on synthetic resin can perform in very similar ways to rosin- based fluxes. They often have significant advantages, too, including greater consistency of quality (rosin is a natural substance and can vary consider- ably in quality), lower fuming, and so on. Where metals are too tarnished for resin-based or rosin-based fluxes, resin fluxes with added activators are often used. Such activators increase the flux’s cleaning activity at the soldering temperature, so improving wetting. Needless to say, such fluxes leave corrosive residues, however. Activators include: @ certain organic halide salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (abbre- viation; DMA HCl), and diethylammonium chloride (DEA HCl) @ organic mono-basic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid @ organic di-basic acids such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, sebacic acid. Activators of the first variety are often called halide activators (as they are based on halides of one of the non-metal halogen elements such as chlorine or bromine) while those of the other two varieties are often called non-', '96 FLUX\\n\\nCATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 97 halide activators. Activating agents are selected according to their activity and corrosion properties, ease of cleaning, as well as their (or their vapours’) effects on humans. Rosin production, as it is a natural substance, depends on adequate harvesting from a currently decreasing source. As such, it has fixed properties and, in future, may not be economic to produce. Synthetic resin substitutes often have superior properties and ultimately may be cheaper. While only limited resin-based fluxes are currently available, more will presumably follow. Organic and inorganic fluxes These fluxes are often of a type known as water soluble fluxes, as their residues after soldering are often soluble in water. They are usually produced to be highly active — taking over where rosin-based and resin- based fluxes cannot cope with high oxide amounts. So, their residues are often highly corrosive and so must be removed after soldering. However, as residues are basically water soluble, this eases cleaning. Formulation is based around use of an activator for surface cleaning of the metal to be soldered, and a solvent to ease application. Often, other substances to aid wetting may also be added. Activators include: @ organic salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (DMA HCl} @ organic acids such as lactic acid @ organic amines such as urea @ inorganic salts such as zinc chloride @ inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid @ inorganic alkalis such as ammonia, while solvents typically include water and alcoho! — of one form or another — and sometimes a mixture of these. Water, however, is not an ideal solvent, as it has a tendency to spatter on rapid application of heat. Halide free fluxes Certain national, international and military standards prohibit use of halides (typically chlorides and bromides) in fluxes. This is because standards authorities often believe halide activators to be more corrosive than other activators. Consequently, a category of flux has arisen known as halide-free fluxes. Typically these use mild activators such as organic acids and amine compounds.', 'CATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 97\\n\\n@\\n\\n98  FLUX   No-clean  fluxes   This  term  relates  to  fluxes  whose  residues  need  not  be  cleaned  from  the   board  after  soldering.  Best and  most  obvious  example  is a pure  rosin  flux   with  no  activators.   No-residue  or low solids fluxes   A  no-residue  flux  is one  which  theoretically  does  not  leave  a  residue.  In   practice,  although  residues of such fluxes  are not visible to the  naked  eye,   some residue--however  little--remains.  No-residue fluxes are one variety   of  no-clean  fluxes  and,  it  is  claimed,  are  excellent  choices  for  many  flux   applications  [Rubin,  1990  #9].   They are formed  from fluxes with  a very low solid  content (as low as 1%,   compared  with  most other flux solid contents of 10 to 40%). This fact gives   rise to  a synonymous  term;  low  solids fluxes.   Preparation  fluids   One  of the most recent advances  in soldering  machine technology  is inert   atmosphere wave  soldering,  in which  assembly  soldering takes  place  in  a   controlled  environment  of  inert  gas m  usually  nitrogen.  Without  oxygen   around the solder wave, further oxides form  neither on the solder nor on the   metallic  surfaces to  be jointed.   The other flux function  of cleaning surfaces in the first place,  on the other   hand,  is  still  required.  While  conventional  fluxes  are  usable  in  an  inert   atmosphere wave soldering machine,  the process lends itself to other forms   of fluxes which  simply preparethe metal surfaces prior to soldering,  leaving   little  or  no  residues  at all.  Such  preparation  fluids  are  available,  typically   based on an acid  in an alcohol  solvent. Most common  to date is a 0.5 to 1%   (by weight)  adipic  acid  mixture  with  anhydrous  2-propanol  (isopropanol).   As such,  of course,  they are  m  c o r r e c t l y -   varieties  of  no residue or  low   solids  fluxes,  although  we  treat  them  here  as  belonging  to  a  separate   category  merely  for  descriptive  purposes.   Choosing a flux   Choice  of flux  in  any application  depends  on  a number  of factors:   It  how solderable the assembly is, in other words,  how clean the assembly   is prior to fluxing  ', '98 FLUX\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 99 Figare 5.5 Principle of brush Sluxing @ whether the assembly must be cleaned after soldering @ what cleaning process is used. Consequently, it’s not hard to appreciate; flux should be chosen to suit cleaning processes, rather than the other way round. Application of fluxes Methods of applying flux are manifold — there are almost as many methods as there are flux types. However, methods are conveniently split into whether assemblies to be fluxed are undergoing CS or SC soldering processes. CS soldering processes imply a liquid flux, while SC soldering processes indicate flux is in paste form (in a mixture with solder particles). We consider only the main fluxing methods in both process variations. CS soldering process flux application As most CS soldering processes are based on wave soldering, it’s here where main CS fluxing methods are considered. Usually one of six main methods is used which, in no particular order, are: @ brush fluxing (shown in Figure 5.5), in which a rotating brush dips into flux and spreads it over the bottom of the assembled printed circuit board passing overhead. Although simple, it is not easy to control amount of flux deposited on the printed circuit board, flux runs down the brush bristles, and brushes can disturb components on the board, Such a basic system has been used, however, in second stages of solder-cut-solder processes where leads have been soldered and cut, but assemblies are still hot — other fluxing systems cannot be used to flux hot assemblies Board direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 99\\n\\nBoard direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\n100 FLUX Photo 5.1 Brush fluxer in operation (Marcont) Figure 5.6 Foam fluxing, in which air is forced through flux to create a head of foam @ foam fluxing (shown in Figure 5.6), where air is forced though an aerator into the flux, generating a foam head of flux over which the assembled printed circuit board is conveyed. Aerators may be of porous stone or plastic tubes, or air nozzles. Itis simple to operate and lower in cost than most other methods. Foam fluxing applies a reasonably thin and even coating of flux and is easily set up to give repeatable results, although no residue or low solids fluxes often only allow acceptable foaming with great difficulty. Porous tubes must be kept clean and not allowed to dry out. Foam heights are usually only around 10 mm or so, $0 there are restrictions on through- hole component lead lengths and where leads have not been cut prior to wave soldering, foam fluxing is usually not possible.

Occasionally, foam fluxers are used with brush fluxers, to create a foam of flux which is then brushed on — this prevents flux running down the bristles of the brush. Hot pallets or printed circuit boards may collapse the foam head, however. Foam fluxing is the most common form, simply because it is the most economical and most easily controlled — foam quality is assured by trying to get it to look like the head of a glass of Guinness! @ spray fluxing. Here, several main variants exist. One uses a finely-holed drum rotating in flux, while air from an air-knife forces flux through the drum’s holes onto the printed circuit board overhead (Figure 5.7). Another uses a compressed air spray nozzle, moved backwards and forwards across the underside of the assembled printed circuit board (Figure 5.8). A third uses a compressed spray principle, comprising a bank of atomizing nozzles,\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 101\\n\\n102 FLUX\\n\\nFigure 5.7  Spray fluxing,  using   an air knife  inside a finely-holed   drum   over  which  the  assembled  printed  circuit  board  passes (Figure  5.9).

Most soldering machines using these fluxing techniques follow the fluxing process with an air knife, to reduce excess levels of flux. This prevents too much flux entering the soldering stage, and so reduces possibility of consequent fire. Fluxer Jevel contro! in fluxers in which flux is recirculated it is usual to provide some form of automatic level maintenance, if only to alleviate the need of the machine operator to top up the flux reservoir. Flux level control is not necessary in any fluxer using a spray system. Often used is a pumped system, where the main body of flux is contained ina large tank. A weir in the fluxer body sets flux level and, as flux is pumped from the tank, it flows into the fluxer, overflows over the weir back to the main tank (Figure 5.12). Overflow Flux reservoir Flux density control As solvents used with fluxes tend to evaporate, some form of maintenance of flux density has to be built into recirculating fluxers open to ambient environments. This is especially necessary with fluxers using low boiling- point solvents such as alcohol. Simplest form of flux density maintenance is a hand-dipped hydrometer. Although basic this is most economical and, if performed frequently enough, is every bit as effective as automatic methods.\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 105\\n\\nOverflow Flux reservoir\\n\\n106 FLUX\\n\\nQuite simple electro-mechanical  systems, using photo-electric detection   of hydrometer  position  have been common  in the past. Figure 5.13  shows   an  example  where  flux  flows  through  a  hydrometer  sensor chamber,   overflowing  at  its  top  to  maintain  a  constant  height  for  the  hydrometer.   When  density  changes,  hydrometer  height  varies.  A  marked  band  on  the   hydrometer neck affects output of a photo-sensitive cell,  indicating whether   the hydrometer  is low or high. This actuates a valve controlling  addition  of   thinners to the flux.   Figure 5.13  Flux density control,   using a simple hydrometer~photo-   electric  cell arrangement to control   addition  of thinners   More  common  now  are  density float-type  sensor  syster~s which  detect   level and density of flux, controlling addition of both flux and thinners to the   reservoir.   An exception to the requirement of flux density control  is in sealed fluxer   units.  Here,  as the whole  system is enclosed,  solvent  evaporation  is  not a   problem  so no density control  (or  level  control,  for that  matter)  is needed.   Flux (or preparation fluid)  is not wasted, so consumption  is greatly reduced.   Flux contamination   As  flux  washes  printed  circuit  boards,  it  removes  some  contamination:   grease from,  say, fingerprints;  chemicals  from  earlier  assembly  processes;   dust, and so on. In all but total Iossfluxing systems (where over-applied flux  \\n\\nThinner reservoir 4 /————} n || | | | | lly \\\\ Photo-electric ja cell Pump ¥| = =| NS Sse “8 / TIT? ie, pene Actuator valve Flux reservoir', 'sc SOLDERING PROCESS FLUX  107   is not recirculated)  such as spray fluxers, this contamination  level builds up   and  may  affect soldering  performance.  In  addition,  flux  does oxidize  at a   slow  rate, so becomes  self-contaminated.   Consequently flux  in  recirculating  systems must be dumped  at intervals   and  all  associated  equipment  must  be thoroughly  cleaned.  Intervals  vary   from  system to  system depending  on  use, assembly  throughput  and  extra   contamination  entering  flux  (from  masks, components,  tape  and  so  on).   Often the only way to specify the interval is to monitor and compare boards   at  the  output  of  the  system regularly  - -   when  flux  contamination  is  a   nuisance,  you  have  passed the stage where flux  should  be dumped.   Preheating in CS soldering processes   Although  preheating  is often classed as part of the soldering process itself,   it can be viewed  as just the  last stage of a flux  application  method.  This  is   because preheating serves to dry the flux; evaporating away solvents  in the   flux to  leave a pure flux  form  on the printed  circuit  board.  So, the topic  is   included  here for  completeness,  although  actual  CS  soldering  process   preheating  methods  are discussed more fully  in  Chapter  7.   Preheating,  in fact, has two main effects.  First, it can reduce spattering of   the flux in the solder wave. Second, and most important,  as solvents do not   have to be first evaporated by the heat in the solder wave, and component   parts within the assembly do not have to be heated to soldering temperature   by just  the  solder  wave,  there  is a  resultant  speeding  up  of the  soldering   process itself. So, while preheating is a distinct process in its own  right,  it is   integral  to both  fluxing  and soldering operations.   SC soldering  process flux   Flux in SC soldering processes is applied before components in a paste form,   mixed  with  solder  powder,  and  known  as  solder  paste. Once  applied,   components  are  added  and  the  assembly  made  ready  for  heating.  In  a   preheating stage (see later) the solder paste is heated till  the flux  becomes   active, so cleaning and maintaining the printed circuit board track surface.   Following this,  further  heating turns the solder powder  into  molten  solder   to complete  the soldering  process.   SC  soldering  processes therefore  have  quite  specific  requirements   which must be monitored and maintained  in order that successful soldering   can  be undertaken.  ', \"sc SOLDERING PROCESS FLUX 107\\n\\n108 FLUX SC soldering process flux application Application of solder paste is performed before components are placed onto the board (as opposed to CS soldering processes, where components are inserted before application of flux). This is quite an important distinction, because the presence of solder paste means that components can be later assembled onto the paste (that is, the paste itself can hold the components in place during the rest of the process). There's a number of ways to apply solder paste, including: @ screen-printing, in which a nylon screen or metal mask stencil is held on a frame above the bare printed circuit board, while solder paste is wiped across and so pushed through the stencil with a squeegee @ syringe-type dispensing nozzles, connected with tubing to a pump which forces solder paste from a reservoir out through the nozzles onto the bare printed circuit board @ pintransfer, where pins are first dropped into a reservoir of solder paste, then lowered onto the bare printed circuit board surface. These three methods are covered in detail in Chapter 6. SC soldering process flux classification There are several ways in which SC soldering process flux is classified in solder paste form: @ alloy type @ powder particle size and shape @ metal content @ flux type @ viscosity. These parameters are covered in depth in Chapter 6. Preheating of solder paste in SC soldering processes Unlike CS soldering processes, where preheating may be considered just the final stage in flux application, preheating of SC soldered assemblies is a distinctly separate step. After solder paste is applied in an SC soldering process components must then be placed in a completely separate opera- tion. Only after the assembly is fully loaded with surface mounted compo- nents can it be preheated. Chapter 8 covers SC soldering process preheating in greater detail.\\n\\n108 FLUX\\n\\n6 Solder paste In typical SC soldering processes — and ina very few CS or mixed soldering processes — solder paste is applied to the printed circuit board first. Following this, components are added, then the assembly is preheated and heated to soldering temperature. Obviously, in such processes the key to successful soldering depends (among other things) on the solder paste itself. Solder paste is a mixture of solder particles together with flux. As the printed circuit board is preheated the flux cleans the board tracks, further heating turns the solder particles into molten solder. This chapter first details how the solder paste is applied to a board in the first place. In some instances, adhesive is used to hold components onto a board (say, if the board is to be inverted prior to adding further components). The application methods for adhesive and solder paste are similar, and in many cases are identical. For this reason this chapter refers to adhesive application also. Finally, the chapter looks at solder paste itself, its special requirements and its main variables. Solder paste or adhesive application Solder paste or adhesive is applied to the surface of a printed circuit board by three main methods: @ screen-printing @ dispensing @ pin transfer. Each has its advantages. Screen printing This description of screen printing of solder paste and adhesive owes thanks to Alan Hobby’s article Practical aspects of printing solder paste [Hobby #26]. The authors are grateful for permission to refer closely.\", 'Two  variations  of screen-printing  of solder  paste  or adhesive  exist,  both   relying on the principle of using a stencil positioned above the printed circuit   board,  through  which  solder  paste  or  adhesive  is  forced.  Printed  circuit   boards  are  positioned  and  held  in  place  during  the  process  normally  by  a   vacuum  pump  arrangement.  Process  is  illustrated  generally  in  Figure  6.1.   Both  manual  and  machine  screen-printing  are common  although  manual   methods  tend  to  give  less accurate  results,  for  obvious  reasons.   In the first variation,  a nylon  (or other  similar  material)  screen  is held  on   a frame a small distance above the bare printed circuit board. Holes between   screen  fibres  are  selectively  filled  with  lacquer  emulsion  or  a  similar   substance  prior  to  printing  with  a  negative  of the  image  of  adhesive  to  be   printed. This is generally done in a photographic way, developing and fixing   the  image  in  the  emulsion  which  hardens,  leaving  the  selected  areas  soft.   After washing to  remove  soft emulsion  areas the screen  stencil  is ready for   use. Solder paste  is applied  to the top of the screen  and a squeegee  is used   to push the screen  down  onto the board  at the same time forcing the solder   paste through the holes in the screen onto the board. Figure 6.2 shows close-   ups of the contact points between squeegee and printed circuit board,  as the   squeegee starts  its stroke (Figure 6.2a) and as it nears the stroke end  (Figure   6.2b).  Ideally,  the solder paste or adhesive  rolls  in front of the squeegee  as   it travels across the screen. This shows it is entering the cavities in the screen   to  pass through  it and  give  a complete  print.   Note the screen  is supported  above the printed  circuit  board  such  that a   print gap is well-defined.  This print gap allows the screen to peel away from   the printed circuit board as the squeegee travels over the surface, rather than   snapping away suddenly.  For this  reason the print gap is also known  as the   snap-off  or the  screen  gap.  If the  screen  does snap  away from  the  printed   circuit  board,  print  quality  is degraded,  so  it  is a condition  to  be  avoided.   Although  the  print  gap  depends  largely  on  particular  applications,  an   approximation  to correct setting can  be found  by multiplying  screen  width   by 0.005,  so a 500  mm  by  500  mm  screen  requires  a print  gap of 2.5  mm   or  so.  Ideally  the  gap  is  the  minimum  to  allow  the  screen  to  peel  away   Figure 6.1  The principle of   screen-printing of solder paste or   adhesive  ', \"110 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nSqueegee Solder paste or adhesive n Stencil Frame Printed circuit board\\n\\nSOLDER PASTE OR ADHESIVE APPLICATION  111   Figure 6.2  Close-ups of the   contact point between squeegee and   printed circuit board,  as (a) the   squeegee starts its stroke and (b) it   approaches the stroke end   immediately  behind  the  squeegee.

Shape depends on   the setup used. Generally, the aim  is to maintain the squeegee tip at a print   angle of around 45 ~ to the screen plane,  shown  in Figure 6.3a. This can be   achieved  with  a  trailing  edge  squeegee (like  that  in  Figure  6.3a)  or  a   diamond-section squeegee (shown in Figure 6.3b). Figure 6.4 shows typical   trailing edge and diamond point squeegees. Note that a much greater print   angle gives poorer  paste or adhesive transfer through  the  stencil,  while  a   much shallower angle gives degraded definition. Squeegee pressure must be   sufficient  to  wipe  paste or  adhesive  cleanly  from  the  stencil  surface  as  it   travels across it, though not so great as to decrease print thickness and cause   spreading ofthe image. Low speed typically causes decreased thickness and   spreading of paste or adhesive.  High speed allows  less time for  the screen   to peel away from  the printed circuit board - -   higher speeds can often be   catered for by increasing print gap, however. Actual values of pressure and   speed,  though,  depend  largely  on  the  viscosity  of  the  solder  paste or   adhesive.  Generally,  higher viscosity  requires  higher  pressure and  lower   speed.

Figure 6.5a shows the main culprit, where   a printed circuit board  is positioned  underneath  a screen. As the squeegee   travels across the screen it forces the screen against the edge of the printed   circuit board. With time m  maybe only a few hundred strokes! - -  the screen   becomes  worn  at these points and tears. This  is understandable when  you   consider thread  diameter  of typical  screens used in  screen-printing  proc-   esses is only  around  0.05  mm.  A simple  surround,  into which  the  printed   circuit board fits, is sufficient to greatly extend screen life (Figure 6.5b). This   ensures the squeegee does not now press the screen against the edge of the   printed  circuit  board.  Ideally the printed  circuit  board  should  be proud  of   the surround by only 0.1  mm, otherwise print quality and thickness  control   may be degraded  near the edge, so careful engineering may be needed. An   alternative  is to restrict squeegee travel  to within  the printed  circuit  board   dimensions.

The very flexing action  itself causes the   problems,  in  that they  act as a pump  to  push  paste behind  the  squeegee   blade, which can force solder paste under the stencil and to bleed onto other   areas of the board. As the squeegee passes over a hole, the flexing action can   also scoop out solder paste so the final result is a thin pad for the components   to sit on  (Figure  6.6a).   Metal  squeegees - -   known  as stencil  blades to  differentiate  them  from   their flexible  cousins E  can  be  used (Figure  6.6b)  to  correct against  both   these actions.  They  have the added  benefit that  lower downward  pressure   (less than 50%) is required.  Increased rigidity means that smaller blades can   be used too.   Metal mask stencils   Where  extremely  fine  detail  of solder  paste application  is required,  nylon   screen-printing  suffers from  the  drawback  that  fibres  of  the  screen itself   prevent accuracy. The second screen-printing variation  sidesteps the prob-   lem by using a thin  metal-plate  mask stencil,  suspended  in a conventional   nylon  screen mesh surround,  as shown  in  Figure 6.7.  Production  of masks   is more  complicated  than  production  of  nylon  screens, although  they  are   often made by a similar photographic placement of image as a resist onto the   metal plate, followed  by etching the areas not covered by the resist. Another  \\n\\nFigure 6.6  Metal squeegees/   stencil blades   method  uses laser  cutting  of  the  stencil,  in  a  technique  which  allows   considerable  accuracy  and  promises  great  potential  for  the  future.  Mask   stencils  have  further  advantages  of  a  much  longer  life  than  nylon  screen   stencils, and they allow a possibility of different thicknesses of deposits onto   the printed  circuit  board.   Where  screen  stencils  require a print gap,  metal  mask stencils are often   used with no gap. This prevents solder paste or adhesive seeping through the   open  holes  in the  mask  (this  doesn't  happen  with  nylon  screens, because   Figure 6.7  Method  of suspending   a  metal plate  mask stencil  in a   surround  of screen  mesh  \", 'SOLDER PASTE OR ADHESIVE APPLICATION 115\\n\\nUneven paste deposit \\\\ Metal stencil) blade\\n\\nSqueegee Solder paste Sereen mesh Metal mask\\n\\n116 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nPhoto 6.3  Laser cutting metal   stencil (Alpha Metals)   fibres within  the screen prevent it). However, the result  is that the holding   vacuum can suck solder paste or adhesive through any holes in the printed   circuit  board  (Figure  6.8a), causing poorly  defined  prints.  Masks can  also   snap quite suddenly from the printed circuit board, degrading image quality.   As a result, small  print gaps of around  0.002  of the  mask width  are used,   which  allow a leakage path for the vacuum  (Figure 6.8b).

For instance,  elec-   tronic  assemblies  with  both  leaded  and  leadless components  often  need   solder paste or adhesive  to be applied  as two  separate assembly  processes   (refer to  Figures 2.25  and  2.29).  Also,  variants  of  new  through-hole  SC   processes need solder paste to be applied  in globules which screen-printing   cannot fulfil  (refer to  Figure 2.28).  Screen-printing  is a technique  suited to   reasonably large batches, too. Where only a small number of assemblies are   to  be  produced,  costs relating  to  screen manufacture,  use  and  clean-up   time  may  be  excessive.  In  such  circumstances,  other  methods  are  more   appropriate.   Syringe-type dispensing  nozzles (Figure  6.9) form  a common  method  of   applying  solder  paste or adhesive.  These are computer-controlled  and  so   programmable  - -   such  that they  are  relatively  easily  adapted  to  different   assemblies, making small batch production viable. This situation suits itself,   also, to assemblies  designed  with  computer  aid as the dispensing program   can be taken direct from the computer.  Nozzles are connected with  tubing   to a pump which forces solder paste from a reservoir out through the nozzles   onto the board.  Figure 6.10 shows a typical  dispensing nozzle, which  uses   a syringe as its solder paste or adhesive  reservoir.  This  is a rotary positive-   Figure 6.9  Syringe-type  dispens-   ing is a  common  method used to   apply solder paste  or adhesive  (a)   the nozzle  is lowered on  to the   printed circuit board (b)  solder   paste  or adhesive  is forced  out of   the nozzle (c) the nozzle  is lifted   clear of the printed circuit board   and moved to the next application   point  ', \"118 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nSolder paste 4 Pump forces or adhesive solder paste or adhesive through nozzle Nozzle Jowered onto board\\n\\n| “T] _\\n\\nNozzle lifted from board Solder paste or adhesive dot left on board\\n\\ny:\\n\\nPhoto 6.6  Dispensing  solder   paste provides flexibility  on boards   with components  that are already   in place ~  such as  in this BGA   rework example   displacement  pump  design.

Dispensing solder paste or adhesive over a complete printed circuit board   is a serial function,  each dot of solder paste or adhesive  is dispensed  in turn   and so overall  dispensing  times  per board  are long compared  with  screen-   Figure 6.11)  Principle  of a syringe-   type dispensing  nozzle,  using a   rotary positive-displacement pump   (Speedline  CAM/ALOT)  \\n\\nDISPENSING 119\\n\\nAir pipe, with air at Elecizic siotor — ~ constant pressure Electric a | a THF in nee | Metal —+4 bellows Syringe Air feed to air cylinder Air cylindei echanice .= Linkage Meta ical yy Bi ; Feed tube\\n\\n120 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\nPhoto  6.7  Bank of adhesive   dispensers (Dynapert)   printing and vary with board complexity.  However, rates of 45,000 dots   per hour are feasible, and some machines may feature multiple dispens-   ing heads which  reduce overall dispensing times per board.  In a typical   pick-and-place assembly line such dispensing machines can easily keep   pace with  component placement.   Although  such machines  are  quite  expensive  in  terms of  financial   outlay,  they are cheap to  run,  and  especially cheap to  adapt from  one   assembly  application  to  another,  simply  by  changing  the  software   program.   Solder addition   Solder addition by dispensing allows larger amounts of solder paste to be   deposited  on  the  board,  it  is typically  used in  automotive  and  mobile   phone applications. The method eliminates rework and avoids the use of   'stepped'  stencils. With  a dual  dispensing  pump  (see Photo  6.8)  both   solder and adhesive may be applied to the board during a single cycle.

The pin matrix takes the same   pattern to which  components  are placed.  As the  matrix  nears the  printed   circuit board surface, surface tension transfers the solder paste or adhesive   onto the printed circuit  board.   The amount of solder paste or adhesive which  is applied to any particular   dispensing  point  on  the  printed  circuit  board  depends  on  a  number  of   factors,  including:   II  pin  size   II  pin  shape   II  depth pin  is dipped  into the reservoir   ti  closeness pin  is positioned above printed circuit board   II  solder paste or adhesive viscosity.   With  careful  design  of  the  pin  matrix,  therefore,  different  amounts  and   shapes of  solder  paste or  adhesive  dots  can  be  applied  with  a single  pin   transfer operation.   Pin transfer,  like screen-printing,  is an application  method suited to high   volume  assembly  production,  because it  is quite  expensive to  produce  a   complicated  pin  matrix.  However  it is, also  like screen-printing,  cheap to   organize and  run once the pin  matrix  has been produced.  \\n\\nUSING SOLDER PASTE 123 Pin matrix lowered “ in matri Solder paste or lowered over Pin matrix board lifted TH ON ORT q i | { hh | # Solder paste or iy 7 u 8 uur v adhesive dots adhesive Pin matrix remain on board Figure 6.12 Pin matrix application of solder paste or adhesive (a) matrix is dipped into reservoir containing solder paste or adhesive (b) matrix is lowered on to the printed circuit board (c) matrix is lified Alternative methods — fine-line technology Where printed circuit boards are to have extremely fine tracks and small component pads, these three methods of solder paste application alone are thought to be limited. Where fine-line technology in which tracks as small as 50 um or less are required, it is often thought supplementary techniques are necessary. Some recent adaptations of pre-soldering coatings using photo-imagable solder resist (see Chapter 3 for a description of solder resists), prior to screening of solder paste or application of molten solder, report resolutions in the order of 15 um tracks with 38 jum spacings. Using solder paste There are several general — though highly important — points to be noted when using solder paste: @ it's best to use pastes which avoid formation of isolated spheres of solder, remaining after SC soldering processes. Such solder balls may form or collect under components, form short circuits, or both @ solder paste of correct thixotropic qualities should be chosen according to application method (see later). Paste should remain on copper track lands and must not slump to other areas @ solder pastes should spread adequately, and exhibit good capillary action @ solder paste should not cause corrosion of printed circuit board and component parts prior to soldering\", 'USING SOLDER PASTE 123\\n\\nPin matrix lowered “ in matri Solder paste or lowered over Pin matrix board lifted TH ON ORT q i | { hh | # Solder paste or iy 7 u 8 uur v adhesive dots adhesive Pin matrix remain on board\\n\\n124 SOLDER PASTE\\n\\n124 SOLDER PASTE @ there must be strict control of solder particle shapes, to minimize solder oxides forming in the paste. Figure 6.13a shows acceptable solder particle shapes (ie, those with as small a surface area as possible), while Figure 6.13b illustrates unacceptable particle shapes (ie, those with relatively large surface areas). Solder paste is strongly hygroscopic, and because of the small solder particles and resultant large surface area, oxidizes very easily. Correct handling is therefore important, to discourage ingress of water and oxygen. Several precautions are recommended {Siemens, 1988 #20], including: @ store solder paste in a clean and dry place @ before opening refrigerated solder paste, keep it for 24 hours at room temperature to avoid water condensation on opening @ use only clean and inert tools @ close the container tightly after required solder paste is removed @ never return paste to its original container once taken out @ do not add thinners to solder paste @ ifthere is to be along delay between printed circuit board application and subsequent soldering, store assemblies at room temperature in a sealed rack to retain tackiness — not ina refrigerator @ follow manufacturers’ instructions. Solder paste parameters In simple terms solder paste is a cream which comprises powdered pre- alloyed solder, homogeneously blended with a suitably activated flux system — the active flux and solder constituents being closely related to those used in conventional soldering. The flux in this solder cream is however incorporated in a chemically stable blend of resins, chemical activators, solvents and viscosity modifiers all of which combine to give the required properties for application and reflow. The specifying parameters for solder creams — and, hence, solder paste — can be broken down into five main categories as follows. Alley type Today, virtually any alloy type can be produced in a solder cream varying from low melting point (around 100°C) alloys containing Bismuth, to high lead-bearing alloys with melting points over 350°C —-a range which equals the range of soft solder alloys in common practical use. For surface mounted component applications in general the eutectic 63/37 alloy melting point of\\n\\n@', '183~   is  most  commonly  used, although  until  fairly  recently  a  large   proportion  of  applications  required  addition  of  a  proportion  of  silver   (typically 2%) to help prevent leaching of silver from the terminations of   surface mounted devices during reflow. Advances such as the inclusion   of  nickel  barriers  in  terminations  and  the  growth  in  solder-coated   components  have, however,  contributed  to  more  widespread  use  of   standard tin  lead alloys with  a consequential  cost saving.  Silver-bearing   alloys are still the norm for the hybrid circuit industry, however, where the   concern  is of course  for the  leaching of silver from  the fired  on  circuit   terminations  rather than the components themselves.   Powder, particle size and shape   The relative shapes of solder powder particles have formed the subject of   much debate within the industry for many years and  it is true to say that   there are certain advantages to be gained from spherical shaped particles   and others from  uniformly  shaped non-spherical  particles.  Figure 6.13   shows some typical solder particle shapes in use. The emphasis here has   to  be  upon  uniformity  as variations  in  powder  shape  and  particle  size   distribution have effects upon viscosity and application characteristics.  In   general terms powders today are produced as near to 100% spherical as   possible  and with  a tight control  on  particle size distribution.   Typical powder sizes in common use are now between 75 microns and   50 microns and for finer printing and high resolution between 50 microns   and 38  microns  in diameter.

In general terms for the surface  mounted  application   this has been optimized at between 85 and 90%. To some extent this is due   to the great difference  in  density between the flux  vehicle  and the solder   powder. A solder cream with lower than 85% metal will contain a very large   proportion by volume of flux and is likely to cause slumping during pre-heat   and reflow.   Flux type   Development  of flux  systems for  surface mounted  applications  has  been   steady and in line with application equipment requirements. In the majority   of applications a mildly active flux is desired; non-corrosive and with limited   halogen  activators.   Use  of  more  highly  active  fluxes  is  often  mistrusted  due  to  a  fear  of   inadequate cleaning processes after soldering leading to long-term reliabil-   ity problems.   Viscosity   Viscosity  requirements  for  solder  creams are  dependent  on  application   techniques only  and  can  be formulated  for  special  applications,  approxi-   mate guide  lines for application  techniques are as follows:   Screen printing through  mesh   600  k cps (centi-poise)   Stencil printing through  m a s k    800-1000  k cps   Dispensing applications   350-600  k cps  ', \"600 k cps (centi-poise)\\n\\n7 CS soldering  processes   All  CS soldering  processes involve  assembly of components to the printed   circuit  board first, followed  by application  of heat and solder. CS soldering   processes can be totally manual, totally automatic, or something in between   the two extremes. Also, assemblies can be soldered component-by-compo-   nent  in  serial  form,  or  altogether  in  a single  parallel  soldering  operation.   Where components are assembled and joints are soldered individually  in a   manual  way,  the  process  is  known  as hand  soldering.  Parallel  soldering   processes, in which all (usually) components are assembled  into the printed   circuit board and the whole assembly's joints are soldered in one operation   are often  known  as mass soldering.   Hand soldering   Hand soldering is a process in which  components are mounted on a circuit   board,  then  individually  soldered,  joint  by  joint,  until  the  assembly  is   completed. Where through-hole assemblies are being soldered (that is, with   components mounted using components leads inserted through holes in the   board),  joints  are of an easily-produced  reasonable size and  are of strong   construction.  Components themselves are large and easily handled,  as are   the tools used. A typical  assembly and soldering process by hand  is shown   in  Figure  7.1,  where  components  are  inserted  after which  the assembly  is   held with  foam  padding and  inverted,  while soldering  is undertaken.  After   soldering (and after rework), it is important that adequate cleaning measures   are undertaken  to remove flux  and other contaminants.   Joint areas, defined primarily by land sizes, have typical values of around   5 mm 2. This ensures that assemblers can easily see the area to be soldered,   and can  manipulate the soldering  iron  and solder with  no difficulty.  Hand   soldering  of through-hole  components  into  circuit  boards  is a well-estab-   lished  and well  defined  process.  \\n\\nFigure 7.1  Typical hand   soldering process  (a) a   leaded component  is inserted   (b) the component  is   clamped in place  (c) the   component's  leads are   soldered (d) excess  leads are   trimmed   Hand  soldering  of  surface  mounted  assemblies,  on  the  other  hand,  is   much  more  d i f f i c u l t -   due  to  the  small  size  of  components,  and  their   corresponding small joint areas. Land areas of much  less than  1 mm 2 mean   that considerable strain is placed on the assembler to solder joints and, even,   to see what  is to be soldered.  Hand  soldering of surface mounted  compo-   nents  is  not,  therefore,  normally  a  process  undertaken  in  any  volume   production  of circuit  boards.   On  the other  hand,  where  surface  mounted  boards are to  be reworked,   say, for repair after manufacture,  hand soldering (and desoldering)  may be   desirable.  So hand tools  and  aids  a r e   available.   Whatever assembly type is to be soldered, it is important to remember that   final  quality  depends  totally  on  the  operator.  Being  a  manual  task, hand   soldering  quality  cannot  be  guaranteed  to  any  high  and  consistent  level,   unless  suitably trained  and  motivated  operators are used.   Soldering irons   Soldering irons for through-hole components are readily available. Tips are   available in a large range of shapes and sizes, some are shown in Figure 7.2.  \", '128 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nof component ms a\\n\\nFoam padding\\n\\nSeams Solder Clipping \\\\ Soldering MAN \\\\ “s ie\\n\\nFigure 7.2  Typical soldering iron   tips for through-hole components   Usually, a medium-sized general-purpose tip is used to solder most types of   through-hole  components,  although  some  specialized  components  may   require  smaller or  larger tips.   Soldering irons specifically for surface mounted component soldering are   becoming  increasingly  more  common.  Unlike  soldering  irons  tips  for   through-hole  components,  tip shape and size for surface mounted compo-   nents are more critical.  Many are available with  tips shaped to fit specific   surface  mounted  components.  Examples of  two  such  tips,  shaped to  fit   common  surface  mounted  components,  are  shown  in  Figure  7.3.  Many   more  are  available.  Where  a  number  of  types  of  components  are  to  be   mounted,  generally,  an  equivalent  number  of  soldering  irons  would  be   used,  eliminating  the  requirement  to  change  the  tip  with  every  new   component  type to be soldered.

When idling, that is, not being used to solder components but still turned on, to the situation where it is being used consistently to solder components, temperature may easily fall from, say, 420°C to around 300°C. So an ‘iron, after idling for a while, may be hot enough to damage temperature-sensitive components. Although less important when soldering through-hole components, this is not an ideal situation, so irons are usually electronically-controlled, to specific temperatures within the 240°C to 400°C temperature range, so that damage to temperature-sensitive compo- nents may be eliminated. Soldering iron types There are four main types of soldering irons: @ individual soldering irons — comprising a hand-held iron together with lead and mains plug @ soldering stations —- comprising a hand-held iron, connected by lead to a control box of some form. Control boxes usually provide controls for temperature of soldering iron tip, and may contain a digital read-out of selected temperature @ cordless soldering irons — comprising a hand-held battery-powered iron (ie, with no connecting lead) and recharging station @ gas soldering irons — running ona small, rechargeable, internal cylinder of gas lighter fuel. Work stations In a production environment, hand soldering is undertaken at a workbench area, normally called a work station. Typically these will feature parts such as cupboards, drawers, lights and so on, together with several accessories: @ component carousels — typically, a tiered rotating construction, with trays to hold components @ bench racks — trays to hold components, mounted in rows @ component storage cabinets — with pull-out drawers for components @ component dispensers — as one component is removed, the next is automatically positioned ready for removal; useful when many components of the same specification are to be soldered @ cable dispensers — holders for reels of cable @ material dispensers — various peripheral materials (adhesive, solder paste, silicon grease and so on) are often required in hand printed circuit board assembly and soldering; material dispensers ensure a predefined amount of material is dispensed', '130 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nSoldering iron types\\n\\nHAND SOLDERING 131 @ bench mats — laid on the surface of a workbench to protect printed circuit board assemblies and other equipment from damage by discarded components or rough worktops. Bench mats are generally anti-static, to protect components damageable by static charges @ printed circuit board work frames — frames to hold printed circuit boards during component assembly and subsequent soldering @ printed circuit board racks — racks to hold printed circuit boards in pre- assembled, partially assembled, or assembled states. These are often antistatic and should be able to hold printed circuit boards without components of adjacent boards touching @ various machines — small drilling machines, wire stripping machines, component lead forming machines, component lead cut-and-clinch machines and so on @ hand tools required for specific soldering job. Ambient lighting, temperature and humidity are also maintained, typically. Peripheral tools A range of hand tools is normally required in hand soldering. Actual tools depend on what type of assembly is to be soldered, but normally include: @ desoldering equipment — see later @ grounded wrist-straps — these form the cheapest and most cost-effective method control over static, preventing damage to sensitive components @ heat sinks — clip-on or squeeze-fit heat-sinks, to use when temperature- sensitive components are to be soldered @ IC insertion tools — special tools which hold integrated circuit legs in correct positions to enable simple insertion into printed circuit boards @ pliers — of several forms, typically miniature snipe-nose, round-nose, flat-nose and hook-nose, as well as larger snipe-nose and combination forms @ screwdrivers — insulated-handle screwdrivers of many sizes to fit flat blade and crossed blade screws @ sidecutters — short-bladed and close-cropping @ spanners — several forms are often required, typically open-ended, box, nut spinners @ trimming knives — with changeable, or snap-off blades @ tweezers — long-nosed tweezers to hold small components and leads @ wirestrippers — many types are available including manual forms with adjustable jaws, gutomatic forms with interchangeable jaw sizes, and special strippers for co-axial cable.', 'HAND SOLDERING 131\\n\\n132 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nHand soldering aids   Where  surface  mounted  components  are  being  soldered,  electrically-   heated  hot plates  may help to prevent damage  due to contraction.  Printed   circuit boards are placed on the hot plate and preheated before components   are placed and soldered, in this way, boards and components are all at more-   or-less the same temperature,  before,  during and after soldering.  Hot plates   can be used to cure and dry adhesive or solder paste, too, although they are   not common.   Magnifying  glasses, or  simple  microscope  arrangements  may  be  used,   also, as sight aids when  soldering  surface  mounted  components.   Generally, around the work area, it is useful to have inspection aids in the   forms  of posters, charts and so on,  illustrating good and bad points  in hand   assembly and  soldering.   Fume extraction   From a safety point of view, solder fumes should be removed from the work   area. This  can  be  done  with  a fairly  simple  fan  arrangement,  or  properly   extracted  by suction.   When extraction methods are chosen, it is common to have the extraction   point in the form  of a suction pipe placed immediately  above the soldering   iron  tip.  Many  soldering  irons  are  available,  complete  with  this  type  of   arrangement.   Flux and flux-cored solder   Soldering of any component to a printed circuit board  requires that flux be   added  prior to,  or at the same time  as, the molten  solder (see earlier).  This   Photo 7.1  Soldering  iron with   fitted solder fume extractor (Hi-   Tech  UK)  \\n\\nHAND SOLDERING 133   is always done, when  hand soldering, with flux-cored  solder wire; compris-   ing a wire of solder containing  cores along  its length, filled  with  flux.  Many   solder alloys  are available  in this form,  with  many types of flux,  and  many   wired  diameters.  For the  hand soldering of electronic  components;  alloy  is   at or close to the eutectic  composition  of tin  and  lead  (around  62%  tin  w   see Chapter  3), with  four to six cores of rosin or synthetic flux  (see Chapter   5),  with  a typical  diameter  of around  1 mm.   Electrostatically sensitive devices   Certain  electronic  components  are sensitive to electrostatic  discharge  (see   Table  7.1 ). When  hand  soldering  such  components  it is important to use a   soldering iron the tip ofwhich  is earthed, using a resistor of a minimum  value   of around  1 O0 kD.. This ensures any part of the soldering  iron tip  is at earth   potential  just  a  few  milliseconds  after  coming  into  contact  with  a  high   electrostatic  potential,  but also ensures that the discharge  is not sufficiently   fast to  damage  the component  at the  high  potential.

It is a tricky,  time-consuming,  operation   requiring some extra tools.  Operators  must be skilled  and fully trained.   First, the solder must be re-heated to be molten, then it must be removed,   prior  to  component  dismounting.  Molten  solder  can  be  removed  using   implements  to  suck  the  solder  away  from  a joint.  Solder  suckers  can  be   separate tools, or form  part of the soldering  iron,  comprising  an air-bulb or   plunger pump mechanism.  Sometimes complete desoldering stations com-   prising hand-held iron-type tools and bench-mounted  stations with  integral   pumps  are used.   Alternatively,  woven copper wire can be made into a braid, called solder   wick,  impregnated  with  flux,  which  has the  effect  of  drawing  the  molten   solder up the braid,  away from  the joint.   Mass CS soldering processes   The usual  mass CS soldering  process  is wave  soldering,  sometimes  called   flow  soldering;  drag  soldering  machines  are  less common;  dip  soldering   machines even  less so, although  there are some of both  types a r o u n d -   if   you look hard enough. One ofthe reasons why wave soldering machines are   generally  preferred  over  other  CS  processes  is  pretty  s i m p l e -   a  wave   soldering  machine  is  easily  included  as  part  of  a  continuous  electronics   assembly  production  line,  using straightforward  conveyor techniques. This   is,  no  doubt,  one  of  the  biggest  advantages  of  the  process.  Other  CS   processes need  more complicated  conveyor techniques.   Wave soldering CS processes are based on one of the oldest technologies   in soldering, and have been around in one form or another for more than 35   years (it was  invented  by Fry's Metals  in the  UK).  Yet wave soldering  is by   no means an outdated process, indeed, adaptations of the basic principle of   wave  soldering  seem able  to  cope  with  every  assembly  variant  designers   throw their way.   To date,  all  types of plated through-hole  assemblies  and  all  but a small   handful of surface mounted assemblies are successfully soldered using wave   soldering.  Further, wave soldering machine manufacturers are totally com-   mitted to upgrading the technology,  always making it able to cope with the   newest of miniaturized  components so, while  it is an old technology,  it still   holds  great  promise  for  the future.  Leaving  aside  any  doubts  about  wave   soldering  process  abilities  to  solder  some  surface  mounted  components,   common through-hole assemblies generally can't be soldered by SC solder-  \", '134 CS SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nDesoldering\\n\\nMASS CS SOLDERING PROCESSES 135\\n\\nMASS CS SOLDERING PROCESSES 135 Photo 7.2 Wave soldering machine (c1960), capoble of soldering 250 mm wide assemblies. Note the modular construction popular with machine manufactur- ers at the time (Electrovert) ing processes, so for as long as through-hole components are used in assemblies wave soldering machines will be commonplace. Nevertheless, wave soldering does have drawbacks. It is a fairly compli- cated process, with some nine groups of variables [Klein Wassink, #4), requiring regular maintenance both during and between operations by experienced staff. Also, running costs are high. Other considerations are the peculiarities of the soldering process which affect circuit board design for successful soldering — more so than any SC soldering process does early design affect wave soldering stages. Wave soldering as a process Atypical wave soldering process is shown, in black diagram form, in Figure 7.4. There are three main parts, sometimes called stations, to the process: @ fluxing @ preheating @ soldering.

Inert atmosphere soldering One recent derivative of wave soldering is the use of inert atmospheres of nitrogen, in which assemblies are soldered. This could change the way we think about soldering processes, for the very simple reason that no longer is it necessary to use a classical flux to clean and maintain the metal surfaces to be soldered. Metal in an inert atmosphere does not oxidize, therefore the surface remains as solderable as it was before entering the inert atmosphere. without any requirement of an active flux coating. Given that the metal surfaces to be soldered are sufficiently clean and solderable in the first place, much less active fluxes — which consequently leave only few residues — may be used. These fluxes have been called preparation fluids, though are really types of no residue or low solids fluxes. The potential for inert atmosphere soldering applications goes even further, however. At the time of writing, it is apparent from early application trials that inert atmosphere soldering machines may, in some instances, be able to dispense with fluxes altogether [Elliott, 1991 #11]. No-flux assem- blies — meaning only minute amounts of residues, hence nocleaning — are now with us. We consider inert atmosphere CS processes later. Handling assemblies In an automated production line loading, conveyance and unloading of printed circuit boards through soldering machines is done with conveyors, of which there are two main types, based on: @ pallets @ fingers. Pallet conveyors By placing assemblies in a frame or pallet (either individually, or as a combination of assemblies in a larger part-punched board — sometimes called a biscuit board), the whole structure can be installed on a conveying system which passes it through all solder machine parts. Typically, pallet conveyors use a roller chain moving in a slot to provide controlled movement. Pins ina pallet engage between chain links; the pallet is moved with a positive drive which provides no slippage. Conveyor drives are considered later.', '136 cs SOLDERING PROCESSES\\n\\nHANDLING ASSEMBLIES 137 Pallets are adjusted to fit assemblies with sliding bar or spring finger mechanisms. They must hold each assembly firmly and accurately, but without undue side force which might bend the printed circuit board at soldering temperature. For solder-cut-solder processes (in which each assembly is soldered, component leads are trimmed, then assemblies are soldered again) pallet conveyors are nearly always used as they give good support from vertical movement as assemblies pass through the cutter stage. Pallets with a fixed central bar or finger set, together with adjustable sliding mechanism either side, may be used to hold two assemblies. However, each pair of assemblies in these pallets must have similar thermal characteristics requiring identical soldering parameters. Tooling plates Assemblies with non-rectangular shapes, without at least two parallel sides for holding and location, must be held in pallets with tooling plates which are routed out to accept an assembly, leaving thin outside flanges for support. Tooling plates are often designed to hold several small assemblies (with similar thermal characteristics) simultaneously. Pallet guidelines There are several important aspects of pallets and tooling plates: @ they must be rigid and not be distorted in handling or exposure to soldering waves @ they must be square and level — check them regularly, say, once a week @ dropped pallets must be removed from service until checked @ they must not introduce contamination into solder. Thus aluminium pallets or tooling plates must be anodized or Teflon-coated (Teflon is a trade mark of Du Pont). Steel pallets or tooling plates must have a blued oxide finish or similar @ they must allow for expansion of the laminate (0.5 mm per side is general) @ pallet and tooling plate finish should be regularly checked. Pallets and tooling plates should be replaced if their finish is damaged, scratched or worn through @ the bottom plane of a pallet should be level with the bottom of the assembly it carries, to avoid the frame depressing the solder wave.']}'\n",
