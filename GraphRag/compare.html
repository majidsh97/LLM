      <td>What are letter codes in the context of BS 4584?</td>
      <td>BS 4584 is a British standard that defines properties of common clad printed circuit board laminates, commonly known as PCB laminates.  The letter codes in Table 1.2 are not provided in the data provided, therefore it is not possible to answer your question. \n</td>
      <td>BS 4584 is a standard for printed circuit board laminates. It defines tests and letter codes for various types of laminates, including EP-GCA-CU-16, EP-GC-CU-2, EP-GC-CU-3, PETP-F-CU-9, PF-CP-CU-5, PF-CP-CU-6, PF-CP-CU-8, PF-CP-CU-14, and PI-F-CU-10 [Data: Entities (314, 315, 316, 317, 318, +more); Relationships (455, 456, 457, 458, 459, +more)]. Letter codes are symbols used to represent specific properties of a laminate [Data: Entities (350)].  \n\nBS 4584 defines letter codes for laminates, which are used to identify their specific properties and characteristics [Data: Relationships (466)]. They are essential for communication and understanding between manufacturers, suppliers, and users of these laminates. For example, 'EP' refers to Epoxide resin, 'GC' to Woven glass fabric, and 'Cu' to Copper conductor [Data: Sources (6)]. These codes are defined in Table 1.2, a document that lists the codes along with their corresponding descriptions [Data: Entities (230)]. \n</td>
      <td>Letter codes are used to represent properties of laminate materials [Data: Reports (70, 485)]. They are defined by BS 4584, a standard for printed circuit board laminates [Data: Reports (69, 70)].  A table listing the codes and corresponding descriptions is included in the BS 4584 standard [Data: Reports (70)]. This system allows for efficient identification and comparison of different materials based on their properties [Data: Reports (485)], which facilitates informed decision-making in various applications [Data: Reports (485)]. \n</td>
