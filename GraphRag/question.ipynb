       "[['9.4 GraphRAG in Industry\\n\\nIn this section, we mainly focus on industrial GraphRAG systems. These systems are characterized by their reliance on industrial graph database systems or their focus on large-scale graph data, details of which are as follows.\\n\\n• GraphRAG (by Microsoft)10: The system uses LLMs to construct entity-based knowledge graphs and pre-generate community summaries of related entity groups, which enables the capture of both local and global relationships within a document collection, thereby enhancing Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task [32]. The project can also utilize open-source RAG toolkits for rapid implementation, such as LlamaIndex11, LangChain12, etc.\\n\\n• GraphRAG (by NebulaGraph)13: The project is the first industrial GraphRAG system, which is developed by NebulaGraph Corporation. The project integrates LLMs into the NebulaGraph database, which aims to deliver more intelligent and precise search results.\\n\\n• GraphRAG (by Antgroup)14: The framework is developed on the foundation of several AI engineering frameworks such as DB-GPT, knowledge graph engine OpenSPG, and graph database TuGraph. Specifically, the system begins by extracting triples from documents using LLMs, which are then stored in the graph database. During the retrieval phase, it identifies keywords from the query, locates corresponding nodes in the graph database, and traverses the subgraph using BFS\\n\\n10https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag\\n\\n11https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/ examples/index structs/knowledge graph/KnowledgeGraphDemo.html\\n\\n12https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph\\n\\n13https://www.nebula-graph.io/posts/graph-RAG\\n\\n14https://github.com/eosphoros-ai/DB-GPT\\n\\nJ.

The project primarily utilizes LLMs to extract nodes, relationships, and their properties from unstructured data, and utilizes the LangChain framework to create structured knowledge graphs.',\n",
       "  '3 Preliminaries\\n\\nIn this section, we introduce background knowledge of GraphRAG for easier comprehension of our survey. First, we introduce Text-Attributed Graphs which is a universal and general format of\\n\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.\\n\\n111:5\\n\\n111:6\\n\\nPeng et al.\\n\\ngraph data used in GraphRAG. Then, we provide formal definitions for two types of models that can be used in the retrieval and generation stages: Graph Neural Networks and Language Models.\\n\\n3.1 Text-Attributed Graphs\\n\\nThe graph data used in Graph RAG can be represented uniformly as Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where nodes and edges possess textual attributes. Formally, a text-attributed graph can be denoted as G = (V, E, A, {x𝑣 }𝑣 ∈ V, {e𝑖,𝑗 }𝑖,𝑗 ∈ E), where V is the set of nodes, E ⊆ V × V is the set of edges, A ∈ {0, 1} | V | × | V | is the adjacent matrix. Additionally, {x𝑣 }𝑣 ∈ V and {e𝑖,𝑗 }𝑖,𝑗 ∈ E are textual attributes of nodes and edges, respectively. One typical kind of TAGs is Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where nodes are entities, edges are relations among entities, and text attributes are the names of entities and relations.\\n\\n3.2 Graph Neural Networks\\n\\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a kind of deep learning framework to model the graph data. Classical GNNs, e.g., GCN [83], GAT [162], GraphSAGE [52], adopt a message-passing manner to obtain node representations. Formally, each node representation h(𝑙 −1) in the 𝑙-th layer is updated 𝑖 by aggregating the information from neighboring nodes and edges:\\n\\nh(𝑙 ) 𝑖 = UPD(h(𝑙 −1) 𝑖 , AGG𝑗 ∈ N (𝑖 ) MSG(h(𝑙 −1) 𝑖 , h(𝑙 −1) 𝑗 , e(𝑙 −1) 𝑖,𝑗 )), (1)\\n\\nwhere N(𝑖 ) represents the neighbors of node 𝑖. MSG denotes the message function, which computes the message based on the node, its neighbor, and the edge between them. AGG refers to the aggregation function that combines the received messages using a permutation-invariant method, such as mean, sum, or max. UPD represents the update function, which updates each node’s attributes with the aggregated messages.\\n\\nSubsequently, a readout function, e.g., mean, sum, or max pooling, can be applied to obtain the global-level representation:\\n\\nh𝐺 = READOUT𝑖 ∈ V𝐺 (h(𝐿) 𝑖 ). (2)\\n\\nIn GraphRAG, GNNs can be utilized to obtain representations of graph data for the retrieval phase, as well as to model the retrieved graph structures.',\n",
       "  '2 Comparison with Related Techniques and Surveys\\n\\nIn this section, we compare Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with related techniques and corresponding surveys, including RAG, LLMs on graphs, and Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA).\\n\\n2.1 RAG\\n\\nRAG combines external knowledge with LLMs for improved task performance, integrating domain- specific information to ensure factuality and credibility. In the past two years, researchers have written many comprehensive surveys about RAG [34, 45, 59, 62, 178, 195, 202]. For example, et al. [34] and Gao et al. [45] categorize RAG methods from the perspectives of retrieval, gen- eration, and augmentation. Zhao et al. [202] review RAG methods for databases with different modalities. Yu et al. [195] systematically summarize the evaluation of RAG methods. These works Fan\\n\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: September 2024.\\n\\nPeng et al.\\n\\nPeng et al.\\n\\nGraph Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Survey\\n\\nprovide a structured synthesis of current RAG methodologies, fostering a deeper understanding and suggesting future directions of the area.\\n\\nFrom a broad perspective, GraphRAG can be seen as a branch of RAG, which retrieves relevant relational knowledge from graph databases instead of text corpus. However, compared to text- based RAG, GraphRAG takes into account the relationships between texts and incorporates the structural information as additional knowledge beyond text. Furthermore, during the construction of graph data, raw text data may undergo filtering and summarization processes, enhancing the refinement of information within the graph data. Although previous surveys on RAG have touched upon GraphRAG, they predominantly center on textual data integration. This paper diverges by placing a primary emphasis on the indexing, retrieval, and utilization of structured graph data, which represents a substantial departure from handling purely textual information and spurs the emergence of many new techniques.',\n",
       "  '6 Conclusion\\n\\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human sensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a na¨ıve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable comparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For situations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi- ties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na¨ıve RAG and achieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\\n\\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.\\n\\n11\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara Fern´andez, Amber Hoak, Andr´es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Billie Rinaldi, Chris Sanchez, Chris Trevino, Christine Caggiano, David Tittsworth, Dayenne de Souza, Douglas Orbaker, Ed Clark, Gabriel Nieves-Ponce, Gaudy Blanco Meneses, Kate Lytvynets, Katy Smith, M´onica Carva- jal, Nathan Evans, Richard Ortega, Rodrigo Racanicci, Sarah Smith, and Shane Solomon.',\n",

Consequently, it’s not hard to appreciate; flux should be chosen to suit cleaning processes, rather than the other way round. Application of fluxes Methods of applying flux are manifold — there are almost as many methods as there are flux types. However, methods are conveniently split into whether assemblies to be fluxed are undergoing CS or SC soldering processes. CS soldering processes imply a liquid flux, while SC soldering processes indicate flux is in paste form (in a mixture with solder particles). We consider only the main fluxing methods in both process variations. CS soldering process flux application As most CS soldering processes are based on wave soldering, it’s here where main CS fluxing methods are considered. Usually one of six main methods is used which, in no particular order, are: @ brush fluxing (shown in Figure 5.5), in which a rotating brush dips into flux and spreads it over the bottom of the assembled printed circuit board passing overhead. Although simple, it is not easy to control amount of flux deposited on the printed circuit board, flux runs down the brush bristles, and brushes can disturb components on the board, Such a basic system has been used, however, in second stages of solder-cut-solder processes where leads have been soldered and cut, but assemblies are still hot — other fluxing systems cannot be used to flux hot assemblies Board direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF FLUXES 99\\n\\nBoard direction >> Rotating brush\\n\\n100 FLUX Photo 5.1 Brush fluxer in operation (Marcont) Figure 5.6 Foam fluxing, in which air is forced through flux to create a head of foam @ foam fluxing (shown in Figure 5.6), where air is forced though an aerator into the flux, generating a foam head of flux over which the assembled printed circuit board is conveyed.

Foam fluxing applies a reasonably thin and even coating of flux and is easily set up to give repeatable results, although no residue or low solids fluxes often only allow acceptable foaming with great difficulty.

Activating agents are selected according to their activity and corrosion properties, ease of cleaning, as well as their (or their vapours’) effects on humans. Rosin production, as it is a natural substance, depends on adequate harvesting from a currently decreasing source. As such, it has fixed properties and, in future, may not be economic to produce. Synthetic resin substitutes often have superior properties and ultimately may be cheaper. While only limited resin-based fluxes are currently available, more will presumably follow. Organic and inorganic fluxes These fluxes are often of a type known as water soluble fluxes, as their residues after soldering are often soluble in water. They are usually produced to be highly active — taking over where rosin-based and resin- based fluxes cannot cope with high oxide amounts. So, their residues are often highly corrosive and so must be removed after soldering. However, as residues are basically water soluble, this eases cleaning. Formulation is based around use of an activator for surface cleaning of the metal to be soldered, and a solvent to ease application. Often, other substances to aid wetting may also be added. Activators include: @ organic salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (DMA HCl} @ organic acids such as lactic acid @ organic amines such as urea @ inorganic salts such as zinc chloride @ inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid @ inorganic alkalis such as ammonia, while solvents typically include water and alcoho! — of one form or another — and sometimes a mixture of these. Water, however, is not an ideal solvent, as it has a tendency to spatter on rapid application of heat. Halide free fluxes Certain national, international and military standards prohibit use of halides (typically chlorides and bromides) in fluxes. This is because standards authorities often believe halide activators to be more corrosive than other activators. Consequently, a category of flux has arisen known as halide-free fluxes. Typically these use mild activators such as organic acids and amine compounds.',\n",

We start by defining some of the many important categorization  methods   currently used. First is simply whether they are based on naturally occurring   or  synthetic  materials.  First flux  ever  used in  electronics  was,  in  fact,  a   natural  material-  gum rosin,  also commonly  called  colophony,  which  is   made from  pine tree sap, a resin. This sap, after distillation,  produces solid   rosin  which  is dissolved  in  an organic  solvent such  as alcohol  to produce   flux.  Most  synthetic  fluxes  are  based  on  organic  acids,  although  other   materials  are used.   Another way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues  remaining from   the flux  after the soldering  process.  Thus,  these are  known  as organically   soluble  fluxes,  or  water  soluble  fluxes.  It's important  to  note  with  this   categorization,  however, that the term soluble refers purely to the residues   left  after  soldering,  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  flux  itself  is   soluble  in  organic  solvents  or  water.  Further,  organically  soluble  flux   residues  can often  be removed just with  water and detergent,  while  many   water soluble fluxes can be removed with  some solvents.  So this categori-   zation of fluxes is not particularly  logical,  although  is still  useful bearing its   limitations  in  mind.   Another  categorization  of  fluxes:  non-activated  fluxes  or  activated   fluxes,  refers to whether  chemicals  have been  added  to  increase  activity.   Generally,  a pure  rosin  flux  is  said  to  be  non-activated,  while  any  other   rosin-based flux  is said to be activated.  With  this method of categorization   it's  particularly  easy to  further  categorize  activated  fluxes  into  grades of   activity,  such as:   L  =   low,  or no flux  or flux  residue activity   M  =  moderate flux  or flux  residue activity   H  =  high flux  or flux  residue activity.   These categories  can  be sub-divided,  say, 0 and  1, to  indicate  absence or   presence of halide  in  a flux.   Yet another categorization  of fluxes groups them  according to composi-   tion.  As  each  compositional  type  of  flux  has  its  own  unique  properties   regarding activity and residue solubility anyway, this method of categoriza-   tion  is perhaps one of the most useful,  particularly as it is commonly  used.   Often abbreviations may be used following this categorization  method; the   abbreviations  deriving  from  various  specifications  and  standards,  and   usually referring to the type of activator added. Table 4.1  lists common flux   abbreviations,  abbreviation  meanings,  subsequent types of flux and activi-   ties  according to this categorization  method.  However,  this  method  gives   little  information  regarding what  activators  or solvents  are  used.  \\n\\nAnother way of categorizing fluxes refers to the residues remaining from\",\n",

As the solder flows it pushes the flux (and its resultant   fluxing action) ahead of it. As the fluxing action moves forward,  so does the   solder to wet  more copper.   Effectiveness  of  a  flux  in  removing  oxide  and  contaminants  from  the   surface  of  metals  is  known  as  its  activity.  Fluxes vary  in  their  chemical   activity.  Type  of  flux  used generally  depends  on  the  oxide  layers  of  the   surfaces to be soldered. If only a thin oxide  layer is present,  a flux with only   a low activity  is required.  On the other hand,  surfaces with  a considerable   oxide  layer require  more  highly  active  fluxes.   Anyone  would  be  forgiven  for  thinking  the  best  solution  to  solder  all   surfaces  is to  use only  highly  active  fluxes.  This  way,  whatever  the  metal   surface and however thick  its oxide  layer, soldering is guaranteed. There is   a price  to  be  paid,  however,  when  highly  active  fluxes  are  used  m   flux   activity  is closely allied  with  the corrosivity  of the residues  remaining after   soldering  has  taken  place.  A  highly  active  flux  often  leaves corrosive   residues  which  may  corrode  the  solder  itself.  Effective  post-soldering   cleaning without  delay,  usually with  water,  is essential.   Categorization  of fluxes   Numbers of different types of flux are hard to evaluate (some 46 different low   solids fluxes alone, from  12 manufacturers worldwide  have been recorded   [Rubin, 1990 #9]), so it's easy to see there must be hundreds if not thousands   of  available  types.  Consequently,  to  say  the  very  least,  it  is  difficult  to   correlate  all  types.  What's  more,  fluxes  have  been  used in  one  form  or   another  for  a  long  t i m e -   since  soldering  first  began.

The molten solder itself can be extremely hot, and moving parts in the equipment present a risk of mechanical injury.', 'Refrences': 'Safety in soldering processes is a vital topic. So vital it must be covered in depth in any book of this nature. Equipment and machines in soldering processes are, by their very construction and use, hazardous. Used prop- erly, of course, they present no danger. But, used improperly, they are lethal weapons — waiting to kill or maim. The authors implore users of such equipment to be careful and to use accepted and safe procedures. In particular we recommend that users: @ read, understand and follow equipment suppliers’ manuals @ sead, understand and follow latest national regulations on uses and storage of materials @ invest in proper safety training @ establish safety regulations and procedures within your work areas, which follow these recommendations @ enforce these established recommendations and procedures among your workforce. ... Safety Soldering of electronics assemblies, indeed the whole assembly process, is a potentially dangerous procedure. You have to remember any industrial process can be lethal. Equipment in electronics assembly is often used with solvents which may be poisonous or explosive. Materials used are often flammable. In many assembly processes, particularly soldering itself, heat is a hazard when combined with these solvents and materials. Solder itself is a lead alloy, so can cause lead poisoning. In molten form solder, need we say it, is hot — very hot— usually at temperatures between 200°C and 350°C in, say, operational wave soldering systems! It can severely burn skin, and will burn through non-protective clothing to get to skin. Most equipment is of a mechanical nature, with moving parts: pulleys, sprockets, pumps, chains and so on. Fingers, hair, neckties, bracelets and so on can easily get caught in moving parts. Mechanically, these moving parts are very strong and may not be stopped simply by a trapped person trying to pull out an object caught in the machine. Serious physical injury can result. All equipment is electrically-powered. High voltages are present in various system parts. At best electric shocks make you jump. Often they cause burns and severe bodily harm.

Non-ionic contaminants might also hinder proper circuit functionality.', 'Refrences': 'Quantities  and exact forms of contaminants  are impossible to p r e d i c t -   it   all  depends  on  processes used and  working  procedures followed.

Further,  contaminants of the first two types may   have a deleterious effect on the soldering process. So it can be an advantage   to clean  before soldering as well  as after.  Such pre-soldering cleaning can   drastically improve overall performance and yield, and mean lower activity   fluxes  can  be  used.

It plays a crucial role in the electronics industry as the demand for miniaturized and complex electronic boards grows, requiring advanced soldering techniques and expertise.', 'Refrences': 'Soldering, as a principle in electronics assembly, is straightforward and simple - two metal surfaces (component termination and a connecting pad on printed circuit board track) are joined by metallic bonds created by molten solder between them.

Most components in an assembly use the mechanical support of soldered joints alone to give adequate fixing into the assembly. A few isolated components (notably, larger, heavier components) may require additional mechanical support, in the form of straps, nuts, bolts and so on. Where possible, however, such large components should be designed out (that is, care should be taken when designing a circuit not to use such components) of an assembly to keep extra procedures and cost to a minimum. On the other hand, all components may use solder as electrical support to form required electrical connections.

      "8 How does the soldering process create a strong and reliable bond between metal parts?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'Soldering creates a strong and reliable bond between metal parts by achieving a clean, metallic contact, leading to the formation of a specific alloy of solder and metal at the junction. This wetting process involves the solder coming into intimate contact with the metal atoms, creating an intermetallic compound which is impossible to remove. The strength of the bond relies on the shear strength of the solder joints, which can reach impressive levels, exceeding the strength of the surrounding materials.', 'Refrences': \"Wetting  is  the  process  in  soldering  where  the  solder  comes  into  direct   metallic contact with the metals to be soldered together into a joint, forming   a  specific  alloy  of solder  and  metal  at the junction.  In turn,  this  implies  a   joint's  metallic  surfaces  should  be  so  clean  that  metallic  contact  can  be   made.   Often, the term  intermetailic  is used to describe  the bond  which  occurs   between solder and metal when the solder wets the metal (as in intermetailic   bond).  This  is  incorrect:  it  is,  in  fact,  a  strict  metallurgic  term  referring to   intermetallic  compounds,  compounds  of elements  whose  atoms  have  an   so  high  an  affinity  that  their   extremely  high  affinity  for  each  other  ~   presence denies  bonding of other elements  by other  means.  To appreciate   the difference  between  intermetallic  compounds  and  alloys  it's  important   to  realize  that  intermetallic  compounds  have  fixed  stoichiornetric  ratios.   Alloys, on  the other  hand,  have  ratios of metals  which  can  vary.   Wetting occurs when  solder comes  into intimate contact with the metal   atoms.  If the  metal  surface  is perfectly clean  and  metal  atoms are  present,   then the solder wets the metal,  forming a bond  with the metal atoms at the   interface  (Figure  1.4).  Once  this  interfacing  bond,  an  intermetallic  com-   pound  as  it happens,  has  been  created  it cannot  be  removed.   If, on the other  hand,  the  metal  is unclean  in any way, say,  it is oxidized   (Figure  1.5)  such that  metal  atoms  are  not  present  on  the  surface,  then   wetting cannot occur ~  in a s imi lar way to which a drop of water on a greasy   surface will  remain  as a  droplet.

      "0 What is flux and what is its main purpose in soldering?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'Flux in soldering is a substance that helps create a clean metal surface for soldering. It removes oxides and contaminants from the metal surfaces, allowing solder to flow smoothly and create a strong bond. Flux also aids in wetting, which means it helps the solder spread out evenly and adhere to the metal.', 'Refrences': '96 FLUX\\n\\nCATEGORIZATION OF FLUXES 97 halide activators. Activating agents are selected according to their activity and corrosion properties, ease of cleaning, as well as their (or their vapours’) effects on humans. Rosin production, as it is a natural substance, depends on adequate harvesting from a currently decreasing source. As such, it has fixed properties and, in future, may not be economic to produce. Synthetic resin substitutes often have superior properties and ultimately may be cheaper. While only limited resin-based fluxes are currently available, more will presumably follow. Organic and inorganic fluxes These fluxes are often of a type known as water soluble fluxes, as their residues after soldering are often soluble in water. They are usually produced to be highly active — taking over where rosin-based and resin- based fluxes cannot cope with high oxide amounts. So, their residues are often highly corrosive and so must be removed after soldering. However, as residues are basically water soluble, this eases cleaning. Formulation is based around use of an activator for surface cleaning of the metal to be soldered, and a solvent to ease application. Often, other substances to aid wetting may also be added. Activators include: @ organic salts such as dimethylammonium chloride (DMA HCl} @ organic acids such as lactic acid @ organic amines such as urea @ inorganic salts such as zinc chloride @ inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid @ inorganic alkalis such as ammonia, while solvents typically include water and alcoho! — of one form or another — and sometimes a mixture of these. Water, however, is not an ideal solvent, as it has a tendency to spatter on rapid application of heat. Halide free fluxes Certain national, international and military standards prohibit use of halides (typically chlorides and bromides) in fluxes. This is because standards authorities often believe halide activators to be more corrosive than other activators. Consequently, a category of flux has arisen known as halide-free fluxes. Typically these use mild activators such as organic acids and amine compounds.', 'Answerable': True}\n",

Commonest contaminant is simply the oxide formed by the metal on its own surface — almost al! metals oxidize immediately on exposure to oxygen in the ambient air and this oxide alone is sufficient to prevent solder wetting the metal surface. To illustrate extent of the problems in cleaning metals ready for soldering, Figure 5.1 shows a section of copper track of an assembly (obviously, not to scale) which shows three distinct layers of material. Most internal is the metal part to be soldered ie, pure metal copper. Next layer is a reaction layer, of strongly bound and so very adherent materials such as oxide, sulphide and carbonate, as well as residues from previous production steps. Finally, and most externally, an absorption layer exists, in which materials such as water, gases and residues from preceding reactions collect. From outside in, therefore, flux must: @ dissolve materials of the absorption layer @ remove oxides, sulphides and carbonates and any other residues @ dissolve some substrate molecules, to initiate formation of intermetallic compounds when solder is applied. Obviously this is a simplification of the job of flux, but it does highlight the process: by cleaning the metal surface then covering it, fluxes keep the surface at a stage of readiness for the solder to flow and wet the metal.', 'Answerable': True}\n",

Another scenario is dewetting, where the alloy bond has formed initially but the solder withdraws from the metal surface and forms dispersed, irregular droplets. This occurs due to high surface tension and can make it difficult to determine if the solder has properly wetted the surface.', 'Refrences': 'If a  contaminant  such   as oxide  is present on  the metal   surface prior to soldering,  no   intermetallic compound  is formed   so wetting  cannot take place   In context with the wetting of metals, two other terms need to be defined.

      "{'Answer': 'Soldering is a fundamental process in electronics assembly. It involves joining components to a printed circuit board (PCB) to form electrical connections. However, the soldering process involves various variables that can influence the quality of the assembly. For example, the solderability of the PCB, the components, the flux, the solder itself, the temperature applied, and the overall process control all play critical roles. If any of these factors are not properly managed, defects or faults can arise in the assembly. These faults can be traced back to a faulty soldering process, but they might also result from issues in the assembly, fabrication, or design phases. In a manufacturing environment, process control is essential for ensuring that the final product meets quality standards. To manage this, manufacturers utilize various methods, including statistical process control (SPC) to monitor and analyze variations in the process. This approach helps identify and correct potential problems before they lead to defects, ultimately minimizing faults during the soldering process.', 'Refrences': \"1 Soldering process This chapter could be seen as just another introduction to soldering — it does, after all, explain in a fairly basic manner all important aspects of soldering in electronics assemblies.

There are, however, many variables which must be maintained to keep the process in control. For example, provided that: @ solderable printed circuit boards @ solderable parts @ good flux @ good solder @ the correct amount of heat for the minimum amount of time @ process control @ process measurement are used, the process stands a good chance of functioning properly. On the other hand, if any of these variables are not correctly maintained problems will arise. Given all these variables, it is not always easy to isolate the cause of any particular problem when things go wrong. Hopefully, Appendix 1 gives some insight— in a light manner — into how easy itis to slip into a situation where problems occur. This appendix attempts to address this — listing, in the table over, some of the problems which can occur in any electronics assembly manufacture, whether by CS or SC soldering process. Possible causes of these problems are also listed, so it is quite a simple job to find solutions which can help get a process back into control. Note that many problems are not necessarily caused by things out of control within the soldering process. Many problems are, indeed, the fault of assembly, fabrication, or design processes which are badly or improperly maintained.\\n224  A V O I D I N G   PROBLEMS m  SOLDERING  QUALITY   With  any defect it's important to remember that problems which cause it can   occur  in any of the manufacturing  stages: design,  fabrication,  assembly  or   soldering.  Defects  which,  on the face of it,  look  like soldering defects may   be caused  by an entirely  separate though  not unrelated  problem.   Have  problems occurred?   Manufacturers control  quality of their products by some method of process   control.  In the minimum,  process control  is exercised  simply by looking at   finished  products  and  saying yes, it  works  or  no,  it  doesn't.  If the  product   doesn't work,  this  has to  be qualified  with  identification  of defects.  Then,   problems  which  cause the defects  must be isolated  and  corrected.   In  effect,  even  in  this  simplest  of  manufacturing  process  control  opera-   tions, products are measured against an acceptable quality standard.  If they   are as good as or better than the standard the manufacturing process can be   called  in-control.  If products  are not as good as the standard,  on the other   hand,  the manufacturing  process  is out-of-control.   Statistical process control   When  manufacturers turn to a mathematical  model to describe manufactur-   ing process control operations,  it is termed statistical process control  (SPC).   Then,  product  variables  and  attributes  are  mapped  as distributions.  What   those  variables  and  attributes  are  depends  on  what  the  manufacturer   perceives  as important.  Typically,  variables  are characteristics  which  take   the form  of real values  such  as assembly  size, weight and so on. Attributes   are  either/or  characteristics,  such  as  good/bad,  there/not  there,  pass/fail   and  so  on.  Standard  values  for  all  variables  and  attributes  must  be  first   determined.   By measuring variables  and attributes for each  product as it is manufac-   tured, distribution  curves for a particular batch of products can be built up.   A distribution  occurs  simply  because  measurement of any product's  char-   acteristics always shows some variation from the quality standard,  no matter   how  small  the variation  is. Then,  acceptable  limits  for  variations  must  be   determined.   Variation  from  standard-  often  known  as a t o l e r a n c e -   is the result of   one or  more causes. There are two  main types  of cause:   @  common  causes  m  random  variations  which  always  occur  to  some   extent in all  processes.

Firstly, they significantly impact the mechanical strength of solder joints, ensuring they can withstand tensile, shear, or combined stresses. This is essential for product reliability and longevity. Secondly, correct placement and assembly methods contribute to efficient and consistent soldering processes, minimizing defects and reducing the need for costly touch-up work. Lastly, these techniques are vital for ensuring compatibility with advanced component technologies, such as surface mount and minimalist packaging, which require precise and controlled soldering operations.', 'Refrences': 'Strength Mechanical strength is a most important criterion when designing soldered joints. Obviously the joint should be strong enough to withstand all possible stresses it may experience: usually tensile, shear or a combination of both. On the other hand, there is little need to design a joint simply to be technically strongest. A knowledge of use of an assembly after manufacture is thus necessary at the first development stages, in order that correct joint types may be incorporated, strong enough to make the product retiable yet not so strong as to make it inordinately expensive. ... joints  can  no longer be made  by hand   because hand soldering cannot guarantee  adequate results with such small   joints. Control of soldering systems has to be precise and closely monitored.   Soldering and,  inevitably,  its control  must be performed  by machines.', 'Answerable': True}\n",

Surface mounted components A number of component types has been developed specifically for use in surface mounted assemblies. New types are frequently being developed, too, so any categorization of those available must change just as frequently. Types The main types, some known simply by their abbreviation, include: @ chips — in this context, the term chip does not refer to an integrated circuit, but to a type of passive component (eg, resistor, capacitor, inductor), rectangular prism shape @ MELF — metal electrode face bonded components, cylindrical shape @ MIFI — miniature ferrite inductors, rectangular prism shape @ SO— small outline components, generally integrated circuits of rectan- gular prism shape @ SOD — small outline diodes, cylindrical shape ®@ SOIC — small outline integrated circuits, rectangular prism shape @ SOT — small outline transistors, rectangular prism shape @ QFP — quad flat-pack integrated circuits having four rows of terminals, rectangular prism shape ® TA8 — tape automated bonding, sometimes called mikropacks, film integrated circuits in taped form, without protective packaging\\n\\nTypes\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES\\n\\n36 ELECTRONICS ASSEMBLIES Figure 2.12 Outline shapes of some common surface mounted components @ tubular — passive components, cylindrical shape @ VSO — very small outline components. in addition, some integrated circuits are mounted into chip carriers, where the term chip does now refer to an integrated circuit, for assembly purposes.

Where through-holes are required to interconnect top and bottom copper track layers, they are plated inside hole barrels with copper, and are called plated through vias. Where a component lead also goes through a via it is called a plated through-hole (PTHs). In a surface mounted double-sided assembly, components are on the same side as boards are soldered. Components may be mounted on both sides of the board. Note, however, a circuit track on one side of the board is not connected to track on the other side unless plated through-holes are used @ multi-layered — in which several circuit track layers are incorporated into a single board, laminated together with insulating layers between each copper layer. (Figure 1.3c). Plated through-holes can be used for either component terminal connection, or purely as electrical connections {in which case they are called vias). Vias passing from one outside track to the other are called through vias, while those connecting internal track layers are called blind, or buried vias. As many as 30 orso layers are typically made into a multi-layered printed circuit board of around 2 mm thickness. Maximum known to the authors is a board with 60 layers, although boards like this are unusual and very costly. Printed circuit board base materials There are many materials used to make printed circuit boards. Generally, for common applications, materials are of thermosetting or thermoplastic plastics, reinforced for rigidity. Reinforcement materials include sheet paper, glass fibre cloth, cotton fabric and nylon. Fillers can be added to influence characteristics. Table 1.1 lists common printed circuit board laminates, according to British Standard BS 4584 and IEC 249 classifications. Where applicable, classifications according tothe commonly known ANS! NEMA LI standard — which, incidentally, does not exist anymore — are also listed for information. To aid clarification of letter codes, Table 1.2 lists codes along with descriptions. Physical and electrical properties of printed circuit board are also standardized by BS 4548 and IEC 249. These are listed in Table 1.3. While the most common material in printed circuit board laminate production is currently woven glass fabric reinforced epoxide resin, it is worth noting that a trend towards flexible polyimide forms of printed circuit boards is taking place in many consumer products — purely for cost purposes.

Solder waves are produced as molten solder is forced up through an ejection chamber, and out through a nozzle, as illustrated in Figure 7.13. After reaching a wave crest, solder falls back into the pot down one or both sides of the chamber. To perform all soldering functions, for every type of assembly, and for as many types of components as possible, requires all assembly and compo- nent variations be taken into account. Thus, different wave soldering machines are available for different applications, varying essentially in waveshape. Waveshapes are dictated by shape of ejection chamber and nozzle.', 'Answerable': True}\n",

      "3 What are some factors that influence the success of soldering?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'The success of soldering depends on various factors, including the use of an inert atmosphere, which eliminates oxygen and oxide formation on molten solder, resulting in reduced dross, lower solder consumption, and improved solder joint formation. Other important factors include proper flux application, which removes oxides from the copper track surface, ensuring high solderability, and maintaining a high level of cleanliness to prevent contamination.', 'Refrences': 'Inert atmosphere soldering\\nBy  encasing  the  wave  soldering  machine  in  an  oxygen-free  atmosphere\\n(using an inert gas such as nitrogen in a tunnel built around the solder wave),\\nseveral benefits are gained.  First, no oxygen means no oxides formed on the\\nsurface of the molten  solder.  This  in turn  means  a great reduction  in dross\\nformation,  indeed  it  is  reported  [Robert  Crothers,  1991  #10]  that  dross\\nremoval  is not required  in such a process during production.  Naturally, this\\nmeans solder consumption  is reduced m  to an extent which almost pays for\\nequipment to  provide  the oxygen-free atmosphere.  There are further  ben-   efits in that maintenance of solder pots is greatly reduced-- from once every\\n40  hours, to around  once every  1400.\\nAn  inert atmosphere prevents oxides from  reforming on the copper track\\nsurface, once removed by flux. This ensures a high level of joint solderability\\nand considerably fewer defects  [Robert Crothers,  1991  # 10],  [Walsh,  1991\\n#12],  [Schouten,  1991 #14].\\nAn  almost total  lack  of oxidization  on  both  copper  and  solder  surfaces\\nmeans solderability of circuit track is at a premium,  with  resultant improved\\nsolder  joint  formation.  Plated  through-hole  wicking  from  bottom  to  top\\nsurfaces  of  assemblies  is  improved,  and  a  general  reduction  in  joint\\nshadowing  are just two typical  advantages  [.Robert Crothers,  1991 #10].\\nBecause of all this fluxes with extremely low solids contents can be used,\\nwhich  simply  prepare  the  track  surfaces by  removing  oxides.  After  track\\npreparation these materials are no longer required - -   a fact which,  coupled\\nwith  the  process  misnomer,  has  led  to  a  presumption  that  absolutely  no\\nresidues remain after soldering. However, this is not the case. Small amounts\\nof  residues always  exist,  as long  as any chemical  at all  is used for copper\\npreparation  [Elliott,  1991  #11 ].', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "4 What is the primary role of solder in the soldering process?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'The primary role of solder in the soldering process is to create a bond between metal surfaces, forming both a mechanical connection that holds components together and an electrical connection that allows current to flow through the circuit.', 'Refrences': 'Soldering, in principle though not in practice, is a reasonably straightfor- ward process, used in the electronics industry to bond components to- gether, forming one or more electrical connections. From this description, it’s easy to see that soldering serves two functions: @ mechanical support — holding components of an assembly together @ electrical support — forming required electrical connections within a circuit.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "5 What are some examples of soldering processes?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'There are three main CS soldering processes: dip soldering, drag soldering, and wave soldering.', 'Refrences': 'There are three main CS soldering processes: @ dip soldering @ drag soldering @ wave soldering.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "6 What is the purpose of solder pots and pumps in soldering?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'Solder pots are containers used to hold molten solder in a wave soldering machine, while pumps are used to circulate the solder and create a wave for soldering. The pots are designed to withstand high temperatures and the weight of the solder, and they must be resistant to corrosion from solder and flux. Pumps usually utilize a centrifugal impeller to circulate the solder, and they are used to adjust the height and flow rate of the solder wave.', 'Refrences': 'Solder in a soldering machine of any CS soldering process is held in a container known as a solder pot. These must withstand high temperatures for eutectic or near-eutectic solder alloys, but possibly as high as 370° or so for high lead content alloys. Solder pots must be unaffected by the solder itself, as well as being unaffected by flux or any flux residues. Solder is extremely heavy, so solder pots must be able to withstand shear bulk and weight. This is especially important when large solder pots are used. They must not bow or bend with solder weight, or warp with high temperature. Usually, a simple centrifugal impeller is used to pump the solder, as shown in Figure 7.10. Molten solder is somewhat inhospitable to bearings, and this method keeps all bearings above. Bearings adjacent to the solder surface are usually of graphite.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "7 What is the role of solder pot heaters?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'Solder pot heaters are typically electric and are used to heat the solder in a solder pot. There are three main ways to connect heaters to solder pots: bolted on externally, as immersion heaters, and positioned in internal tubes.', 'Refrences': 'Heaters used in solder pots are usually electric (in fact, no other heating methods are known to the authors), although there is no reason why other methods can’t be used. Heaters are connected to solder pots in three main ways: @ bolted on externally @ as immersion heaters, protruding directly into the solder @ positioned in internal tubes mounted into the solder pot.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "8 What are joints in the context of the text?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'In the context of the text, a joint refers to the connection between two or more metal parts in an electronic assembly, primarily through soldering. There are two main categories of joints: through-hole and surface mount joints.  Different joint types include butt joints, single overlap joints, double overlap joints, and ring and plug joints.  These joints are characterized by their strength, which is determined by the specific design and materials used in the connection.', 'Refrences': 'For electronics  assemblies there are two  main  categories of joints:   II  through-hole joints   II  surface mount joints.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
      "9 What factors determine the strength of a joint?\n",
      "{'Answer': 'The strength of a joint depends on various factors such as the type of joint (butt, overlap, ring and plug), solder thickness, soldering temperature, and the hole-to-lead size ratio.  Tensile strength is crucial for butt joints, while shear strength is more important for other types like ring and plug joints.  The strength of a joint also varies with solder thickness and temperature, as illustrated in the figures mentioned in the text.', 'Refrences': 'Strength\\n\\nTREE BOTS TE\\n\\nTensile strength   The joint which  relies most on tensile strength for its function  is a butt joint.   It is the simplest joint form  and solder in the joint  is theoretically  stressed at   90 ~ to  its interfaces,  thus  is the best indicator  of maximum  tensile  strength   of a solder joint.   As stress occurs  at 90 ~ to joint  interfaces,  strength  is high;  Thwaites  and   Duckett  [Thwaites,  1976  #1]  report  measured  strengths  of  9.4  kgf  mm -2.   Strength  does  however  vary  considerably  with  solder  thickness  (ie,  joint   gap).  Figure 2.2  shows variation  of tensile strength for solder thickness  in a   standard butt joint.  Interestingly tensile strength of butt joints  is greater than   that of bulk  solder  (3.5  kgf mm-2), also shown  on the graph  for  reference.   Shear strength   Remaining  three  joint  types  are  felt,  by  Thwaites  and  Duckett,  to  more   closely  demonstrate  shear strength,  with  ring  and  plug  even  more  so than   the others. A shear strength of 3.7  kgf mm -2 is typical  in a ring and plug joint,   while the overlap joint has a joint strength of 4  kgf mm -2 - -   which  indicates   other strengths exist in an overlap joint.  This is probably due to the fact the   two  metal  plates cannot  lie  in the same plane as they are offset (part of the   joint design), so while shear strength is initially measured as load is applied,   twisting  of the joint  adds some tensile strength  into the result.  Interestingly   double  overlap  joints  are typically  less strong than  single  overlap  joints.

Finally, joint strength also varies with soldering temperature, as shown in   Figure  2.4,  where  overlap,  ring  and  plug,  and  butt  joint  strengths  are   compared.

To put this in perspective, peel strengths of typical printed circuit boards are such that copper track peels from a circuit board if a force of just a small fraction of possible solder joint tensile strength is applied over the few square millimetres of a soldered joint. In effect, materials surrounding a perfectly made joint usually form a limit to a solder joint — not the joint itself. Through-hole joints Through-hole joints rely on the single fact that a wire lead is inserted through a hole in the board, then soldered to bond to a metal track. However, certain factors may differ and affect the exact type of joint, such that four different types of through-hole joint have been specified by previous authors: @ non-plated through-hole, straight lead @ non-plated through-hole, clinched lead @ plated through-hole, straight lead @ plated through-hole, clinched lead. In the following discussion, it is assumed that all joints are perfect, with good, continuous, wetting al! round the area. Non-plated through-hole, straight lead Figure 2.5 shows the joint obtained when a straight component lead is soldered in a non-plated through-hole, such as would be obtained in a single-sided circuit board. This is the easiest through-hole joint to manufacture, as few processes, apart from insertion and soldering, are called for. It is, correspondingly, the weakest through-hole joint, however. Seen in cross-section as in Figure 2.5 it’s clear the joint is similar to the ring and plug joint discussed earlier, which basically depends on shear strength of a solder joint for its strength, so can be expected to have strengths of at least 3 kgf mm”.', 'Answerable': True}\n",
