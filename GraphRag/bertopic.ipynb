      "This text describes a new large language model (LLM) called WizardLM. WizardLM is trained on a large dataset of instructions generated by an AI system called Evol-Instruct. Evol-Instruct creates complex instructions by gradually rewriting simpler ones. The researchers found that instructions generated by Evol-Instruct are better than those created by humans. WizardLM outperforms OpenAI's ChatGPT in some tasks, demonstrating the potential of AI-evolved instructions for improving LLMs. The code and data for WizardLM are publicly available. \n",
